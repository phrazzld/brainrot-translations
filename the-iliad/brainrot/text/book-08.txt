dawn pulled up in her saffron robe, stunting on the whole earth,
and father zeus, the lightning lord, assembled the olympian fam
way high on that many-peaked mount olympus, top-floor vibes.
he spat facts to all gods and goddesses: “yo, pay attention,
no one cross my new edict, male or female divinity,
cuz i’m about to lay down the cosmic law, and you better say ‘bet.’
if i catch any of y’all ghosting my plan or dipping down
to hype the trojans or the achaeans without my go-ahead,
best believe i’m flinging you into the dank pit of tartarus,
so low it’s basically off the grid.
you’ll meet iron gates, a bronze threshold, deeper than hades is beneath the land—
then, for sure, you’ll figure out who’s top dog on olympus.
like, if you’re feeling bold, come test me: drop a golden rope from the sky,
all gods and goddesses can tug on it, you still won’t pull me down.
but if i feel like pulling, i’ll yank you all up easy,
tie that rope round the peak of olympus, and the whole cosmos will dangle.
yeah, i’m that unstoppable, whether among immortals or mortals.”

the squad heard that speech and went hush, jaws on the floor
‘cause zeus was big mad, no cap. finally, owl-eyed athena stepped forward,
like, “dad, we all know your cosmic flex is unstoppable, we get it,
but can we at least show some pity for the poor greek warriors
who are about to get absolutely bodied out there?
fine, we won’t jump in the actual rumble if you say so,
but let’s at least lob some helpful strats so they don’t all get clapped.”

zeus beamed at her, big thundercloud grin:
“relax, triton-born bestie, i’m not out here to wreck your vibe.”
with that, the thunder-god readied his brazen-hooved stallions,
their manes shimmering in gold. he decked himself in gold too,
snatched the golden whip, hopped in his shining chariot,
whipped the reins, and soared between heaven’s starry dome and the broad earth.
he touched down on ida, mother of beasts with gushing springs,
posted up at gargaron, where there’s a big altar to him.
he tethered his horses, cloaking them in swirls of mist,
sat on the mountain crest with a boss vantage,
peeping the trojan city and the greek ships.

meanwhile, the achaeans with the luscious locks
crushed a quick meal by their tents and strapped on their gear.
the trojans, fewer in count but still hyped, got set inside their walls,
knowing they had no choice but to scrap for their kids and wives.
all city gates flung open, the people poured out—infantry, cavalry,
the rumble was thunderous. soon as they massed in the same field,
shields clashed, spears bristled, men’s energies collided,
and a chorus of shouts and prayers to gods filled the air.
blood soaked the ground as warriors dropped like flies.
they fought from dawn’s first sparkle until midday sun blazed overhead,
and that’s when father zeus bust out the golden scales,
put the fates of trojans and bronze-shirted achaeans on either side,
lifted the balance, and doom fell heavier on the greeks.
their destiny sank, trojan fate soared to the sky.
zeus thundered loud, shot a blazing thunderbolt among the greeks—
the flash spooked them all, and their morale caved.

most of the greek heroes noped right out—agamemnon, idomeneus,
both ajaxes, none had the nerve to stand except old nestor,
and that was only cuz his horse got popped by paris with an arrow
right in the skull’s crest, where the mane sprouts, prime kill spot.
while nestor freaked, hacking the reins free with his sword,
hector’s wild chariot came barreling in, driven by destiny.
diomedes saw nestor about to get murked and bellowed at odysseus,
“bruh, where you going? you bailing like a coward?
someone’s gonna nail you in the back if you keep running. help me save the old man!”
odysseus played deaf, sprinted for the ships.
diomedes hopped off, shield up, right next to nestor,
and he’s like, “grandpa, it’s tough being you: the young punks outrun you,
and your war-juice is kinda dry, plus your horses are slow.
hop on my rig, see how these trojan stallions handle the dirt—
got ‘em from aeneas once upon a time, insane speed, no cap.
my crew can watch yours, let’s go steamroll hector. we’ll see if the trojan goat
can handle my spear or if i’ll tag him for a highlight reel.”
nestor hopped aboard, they sped forward. diomedes aimed his spear at hector,
but missed and nailed the chariot driver, the dude holding the reins,
straight to the chest. buddy flopped out, and trojan stallions reared up in shock.
hector took it hard but called over a new driver asap—
archEPTolemos hopped in, seized the lines, no breaks in the chase.
but zeus let loose a savage thunderbolt right in front of diomedes’ team,
fire swirling, the horses balked, the reins slipped out of nestor’s hands.
fear slapped nestor’s heart. “td’s son, fall back,
you see big daddy zeus is not about giving us the dub today.
maybe tomorrow we get our turn, but right now, he’s handing hector the W.”

diomedes, fuming: “i feel you, but man, hector’s gonna flex so hard,
he’ll say i chickened out. that’s the worst.”
nestor was all, “bro, let him talk, we know the real tea:
he’ll never fool his people that you’re a wimp. you’ve left plenty trojans
faceplanted in the dust. let’s bounce.”
so they dipped, the trojans roared, and hector boomed:
“tydeus’ kid, the greeks used to worship you at fancy banquets,
giving you prime seats and big cuts of meat—
guess they’ll ghost you now, you turned out to be a meltdown.
scram back to your ships, you ain’t messing with my walls or my wifeys.
i’ll crush you first.”

thrice diomedes thought about spinning his horses around, thrice zeus thundered from ida,
handing the trojans that unstoppable vibe.
hector shouted to his squad, “trojans, lycians, dardanians,
flex your savage hearts! father zeus is with us.
they built that flimsy ditch and wall hoping to lock us out,
but my horses jump that trench easy.
once we torch their ships, i want no survivors.
i want them burning in black smoke, i want them done.
bring up the cattle, quick! get the wine, get the grain, build fires,
so if they try to dip at night, we’ll spot them and chunk a spear,
make them remember rolling up on trojan turf.
let’s keep guard the whole night, no surprise raids, no slip-ups.
tomorrow at dawn, we slice ‘em down or push them onto their ships.
then we’ll see if diomedes stands or folds. bet he’s the first to drop.”

the trojans popped off at that, unyoking sweaty horses,
brought up rations, sweet wine, and arms full of wood.
they sacrificed out on the field, but the wind carried their smoke
straight up to the sky, overshadowing the plain.
meanwhile, they lit a thousand fires, turned night into starry blaze.
like how crisp the world looks around a full moon in a windless sky,
where mountain peaks and headlands all sparkle wide open,
so did the trojan campfires glitter between the greek ships and the xanthos river.
a thousand fires, and by each one fifty trojans chilled in the glare.
their horses munched white barley and oats, standing beside the chariots,
waiting for dawn’s next savage show.
