yoooo, so the trojans were posted up on their watch, all vigilant on the walls n stuff,
while the achaians sat there totally spooked, trembling in that frosty fear vibe.
all the top-tier fighters were big sad, losing faith like the tide when the moon ghosted it,
kinda like when two savage winds pop off on the fishy sea, north and west,
raging straight outta thrace—boom, the black waves get rowdy, spitting seaweed everywhere.
that was the literal emotional roil in each achaian’s chest, swirling gloom in their hearts.

meanwhile, king atrides was pacing, heart hammered by that massive sorrow.
he told his hype men with the strong voices: “summon every guy by name to the assembly—
but do it hush-hush, no big public outcry. i’ll be there in front to vibe with the top dogs.”
the crew gathered, each gloomier than the last.
agamemnon took center stage, tears streaming heavy, like a black-water spring
spilling from a cliff-face all shadowy and dramatic.
between sobs, the big boss spat out:

“my dudes, captains of argos, it’s straight tragic:
zeus the kronid locked me in confusion, then left me on read.
he once gave me the nod—like ‘bro, you’ll wreck ilion’s walls and bounce home easy’—
but now he’s done me dirty, telling me to bounce back to argos in shame,
after i basically wasted an entire army for nothing.
zeus, that unstoppable force, apparently loves to watch city after city crumble;
our time’s up, i guess. we should all dip with the ships back to the homeland.
ain’t no way we’re capping troy’s broad-street flex no more.”

everyone went radio-silent.
finally diomedes, that absolute warlord, said:
“atrides, i gotta clap back ‘cause you’re out here disrespecting me as if i’m weak sauce.
like, for real, you said i’m no fighter? that’s wild, man. all these youngsters and old heads know
the son of crooked-minded kronos gave you half a gift: you got the fancy scepter,
big throne vibes, but the raw strength he withheld—sad day.
you think the rest of us are incompetent? be real, bro.
if your own heart says bounce, you do you, your ships are near the sea, just go.
but us real ones are staying right here—my boy sthenelus and i will keep scrapping
till we see troy smolder or we pass into dust, no cap.”

all the achaians cheered that savage retort.
then wise old nestor got up, the horse-tamer from pylos, always spouting wise bars:
“tydeus’ son, you’re top-tier in war and counsel—no one’s hating on that.
but you’re also mad young. let me go deeper, i’m older than you (big flex).
we can’t praise a man who thirsts for civil war or meltdown from within.
tonight, let’s not do anything cray—keep watch outside the ditch.
younger bros, handle that. atrides, you cook for the elders:
we got plenty wine shipments rolling in from thrace each day.
invite the elder statesmen, hear advice from all corners,
’cause, ngl, the trojans got the sauce right now, lighting up fires near our ships,
and we either crush them at dawn or lose everything by night’s end.”

everyone was like, “legit plan,” so they set watchers in the trench,
and nestor’s son thrasymedes led the watchers with others—
askalaphus, ialmenus, meriones, aphareus, deipyrus,
and shining lykomedes. each group had a hundred spears,
torches blazing, posted between the ditch and the towering wall,
roasting their dinners there.

agamemnon, the big man, took the elder chiefs to his tent
and laid out a feast that slapped.
once they’d eaten and sipped enough to loosen their tongues,
old nestor began weaving his strategy,
like he was the top craftsperson of words:
“king of men, atrides, you got the staff from zeus,
so you gotta keep your ears open for truth from your circle.
i told you from the jump not to snatch achilles’ prize—did you listen? no.
you dissed the best fighter among us, straight up.
still, maybe we can fix this. line up a massive apology.
smooth him with gifts and sweet talk—maybe we reel him back in.”

agamemnon sighed: “you’re right, i messed up. i won’t deny it.
that man’s basically unstoppable, and i dissed him.
so i’m ready to shower him with epic gifts—
seven tripods never kissed by flame,
ten gold bars, twenty shining cauldrons,
twelve stallions that racked up trophies.
he can’t say i got no gold or horses. i’ll give him seven lesbos queens, top-tier in looks,
plus briseis, untouched by me in the bed department, i swear it.
and if we bust troy eventually, i’ll load his ship with gold and bronze aplenty,
even let him pick twenty trojan baddies (except helen, obviously) if he wants.
back at argos, i’ll treat him like my own son orestes—he can marry one of my daughters
with no bride-price, i’ll throw in stacks of gifts and choose him seven towns,
with folks who’ll worship him like a literal demigod.
all i ask is he swallow that anger—
hades is the only one who never lets go of grudges, so c’mon now.”

nestor was like, “dang, those are dope offerings. let’s fetch achilles.
we’ll pick phoenix, odysseus, big ajax, plus a couple heralds.
we’ll do a vibe check and see if achilles’ heart thaws.”
they blessed the wine, did their typical godly incantations, then rolled out.

along the shore they went, praying to the earth-shaker poseidon
to soften achilles’ massive pride.
they found him in his tent vibing with a dope-sounding lyre,
singing about epic deeds of men from yore, while pat sat silent,
waiting for the jam to end.
odysseus led the squad inside, achilles jumped up, lyre in hand,
patroclus too hopped to greet them.
achilles said, “hey bros, you’re dear to me even if i’m in meltdown mode.
come chill in my pad.”

they sat down on plush seats,
and achilles told pat: “bust out a bigger bowl, pour that strong vintage,
these are my homies, the realest ones.”
they slaughtered some meat, grilled it, salted it, feasted good.
odysseus, the sly talker, took a big sip, said:
“achilles, we’re loaded on fine eats, but that’s not the main point.
the ships are about to go up in flames. hektor’s on a rampage with zeus backing him.
the trojans are stacked near the walls, burning fires, screaming to rip our hulls at dawn.
bro, if you don’t help, it’s basically ggs for the rest of us.
remember what your dad peleus told you on the day he sent you here—
he said keep your pride in check so the people will love you.
well, you’re a legend, so let that anger go.
agamemnon’s handing out lavish gifts, the biggest peace offering ever.
come back and save us, man. you’ll regret it if you let us burn.”

achilles responded: “odysseus, no more sugarcoating. i’m done playing.
i can’t stand fakes who say one thing but think another.
here’s the tea: i’m not feeling these so-called ‘rewards’ from that dogface atrides.
the same share goes to the hero who fights or the clown who hides.
why break my back? what do i get?
he took my girl—my personal war prize—like i’m some rando.
anyway, tomorrow i’m out. i’ll sail home early and leave you all to figure it out.
i might come back if hektor literally stands at my own ship’s door, but until then, miss me with it.”

everyone just went silent. phoenix, old father-figure vibes, started sobbing:
“achilles, my child, i raised you, i endured your tantrums.
don’t ditch us now. remember that men can even placate the gods with prayers.
if some fool crosses the line, they sacrifice and grovel, and the gods chill.
why can’t you do that? do it for me if not for them.
if you wait too long and the ships burn, no gifts for you, just regrets.”

achilles said, “phoenix, my guy, i love you, but don’t push me.
i can’t stand the dude who robbed me, so don’t side with him.
stay with me if you want, i’ll treat you like a king.
but if you’re loyal to him, i guess we ain’t besties anymore.”

after that, big ajax was like, “enough.
achilles is still pressed about that girl. we’re literally offering him insane loot.
people accept blood-price even for a murdered brother or son,
but achilles won’t budge. that’s messed up.
let’s bounce back and tell the squad. maybe the gods will show us some other way.”

achilles said, “ajax, i hear you, but my anger is deeper than the ocean.
i won’t lift a spear until hektor is torching my own ships.
then maybe i’ll step in.”

with that, they poured a final libation and parted.
phoenix stayed behind at achilles’ place;
ajax and odysseus headed back,
gave the sad news to the waiting achaians in agamemnon’s big tent.
everyone sat in bummed-out silence till diomedes spoke:
“agamemnon, why beg a dude so stuck in his feelings?
let him do his thing or not. tomorrow we fight on.
dawn’s light, we arm up, i’ll be on the front lines,
maybe the gods will bless us—maybe not. no point crying about it.”

everyone nodded, did their final toasts, and crashed for the night,
all the while the threat of trojan fire looming large in their dreams.
