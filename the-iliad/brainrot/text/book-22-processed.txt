yooo, muse, stream me that final meltdown of troy’s champion—helmet-lord hector—
who got destiny’s death-grip out by the skaean gates while his homies cowered behind stone walls.
like sweaty little fawns they were, gasping for air, slumped along the ramparts,
while swift-footed achilles swaggered closer, shoulders braced under that broad shield, ready to shred.

fate chained hector right where the gate stands, froze his flight, no lie,
and apollo—the bow-flex god, golden vibes—trolled achilles a sec,
saying “yo mortal, why you chasing an immortal? you can’t clap me, so hush,”
then ghosted, leaving peleus’s boy fuming over stolen kills and lost clout.

away achilles bolts, all winner’s-lap energy,
like some champion steed unbridled, dust swirling under vicious hooves.
king priam, perched high, saw his armor flash like orion’s dog-star—
that bad omen star that hammers folks with fever—shining, savage, unstoppable.

priam tore at his frosty hair, bawling at his son below:
“hector, my dear blood, do not 1v1 that unstoppable spawn of the sea-nymph.
come inside, or i swear i’ll watch your funeral fires from this cursed throne.
have mercy on your mother’s tears and my old-man sorrow. dip back through the gates, i beg you.”

hecuba joined in, baring the breast he once fed from, crying “son, do not feed your pride to that rage machine.
don’t let achilles add your name to his kill list. think of me, who carried you, precious in my womb!”
yet hector stood firm, coiled up like a venomous serpent, refusing retreat.
he spat: “nah, can’t let trojans say i chickened out. better to die glitzed in glory.

“maybe i’ll offer helen back, with the loot, pay the achaeans big time.
but who am i kidding? swift-footed’s too heated to deal.
best i show my mettle, strike or fall with a legendary last stand.”
just then, achilles, raging bright as a fired-up brand, closed in.

hector’s nerve broke; he sprinted around the city’s curve,
like a skittish pigeon chased by a hawk locked on. three laps they made,
the watchers above in shock, the gods on olympus scoping the drama.
zeus felt pity for trojan’s golden boy but got shut down by owl-eyed athena: “nah, father, it’s time.”

she soared down, disguised as deiphobus, coaxing hector: “bro, let’s hold ground.
we’ll stand as two against that unstoppable demigod.”
hector, relieved, whirled on achilles, called out for a handshake deal:
“if i kill you, i’ll honor your corpse. you kill me, do the same. let’s keep it real.”

achilles just sneered: “lol no. wolves and lambs never sign treaties.
one of us must feed aries a bloody meal. talk’s done.”
the spear flew—hector ducked—clanged off the ground,
but sly athena gave it back to achilles, unseen.

hector hurled his own spear, pegged achilles’s shield center,
but the bronze rebounded, leaving the trojan champion high and dry.
calling for deiphobus? ghosted—he knew the gods had played him.
“so i guess i’m done,” he muttered, “but let me die big so they remember.”

he drew his sword, lunged like an eagle after a helpless lamb,
while achilles charged, shield covering his chest, helm blazing,
the gold crest streaming like a small star’s glow on a savage night.
he spied that gap by hector’s collar, jammed the spear in deep.

hector crashed to the dust, blood soaking the sand.
achilles crowed, “you thought you could slay me and strut off? no shot.
my friend pat went down, but we’ll mourn him in honor. your corpse?
dogs and crows get the buffet. your folks can watch from afar.”

hector, choking on death, pleaded, “at least spare me the dogs, i beg you,”
but achilles spat: “boy, i’d devour you raw if i could. no deal.
not even your father’s gold can shield you now. no funeral bed, no final tears.”
last breath in his throat, hector gasped a prophecy: “watch your back; apollo and paris will get you.”

then his soul slipped away, lamenting lost youth.
achilles tore the spear free, stripped the brilliant armor,
and the other achaeans ringed around, each giving a little stab,
murmuring, “this the same dude who tried to torch our ships? not so tough.”

swift achilles then shouted, “we got him, trojans might fold, or might not.
but i gotta bury pat, can’t keep ignoring him.
strap hector up, haul him back: we earned this clout,
this trojan god they worshipped, undone by my spear.”

and so he does a savage flex: bores holes in hector’s ankles, threads rawhide,
ties him behind the chariot to drag that once-proud head in the dust.
the black earth churned with blood, hair, and sorrow while the trojans on the walls howled,
priam crumpling, hecuba shrieking, the city’s wail like a blazing tower.

andromache, weaving at home, dreamt of warm baths for her triumphant spouse,
heard the cries, rushed out, saw her man dragged in the filth.
she fainted, flinging off her bright headband and shining veil—
the gifts from aphrodite for her wedding day to hector.

gasping awake, she mourned: “hector, i’m left a widow, our child fatherless.
once the city’s darling, now all is ruin. dogs devour you far from your father’s arms,
and i’ll burn your fine clothes in grief—since they can’t warm you now.
this is how our story ends, a tragedy stamped on trojan hearts.”

so she sobbed, and the women around her joined that heartbreak chorus,
the once-unstoppable champion gone, the city drowning in tears.
