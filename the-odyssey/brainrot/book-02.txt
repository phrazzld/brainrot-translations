yap at me muse, 'cause next morning hits with that big dawn glow—
our boy telemachus unplugs from his sadboy bed,
throws on a clean fit, straps a sharp blade across his shoulder,
slips on some fire kicks (shiny af),
and struts out the bedroom looking god-tier, no cap.

he instantly hollers at the heralds with those big-lung voices,
“round up the homies—time for an assembly.”
the word spreads hella fast and all of ithaca’s men gather pronto.
telemachus heads for the meeting spot, spear in hand,
his two dogs trotting behind, radiating *that aura*, courtesy of athena.
everyone parts to let him sit on his dad’s old throne.
respect.

first to speak is this elderly real one named aegyptius,
bent with age but big on wisdom.
dude’s got four sons; one got eaten by the cyclops, big rip,
another’s a suitor mooching at tele’s place,
and two more stick to normal vibes.
tears in his eyes, aegyptius goes, “this is the first assembly in ages.
who called it? maybe some urgent tea from travelers or something?
whoever it is, may zeus bless ‘em for stirring the pot.”

telemachus, feeling that, stands up:
“old-timer, yeah, it’s me who called y’all up.
no big war news or anything, just personal meltdown time, fr.
my father—once the best big-boss over ithaca,
kind like a father to all—poof, gone.
worse yet, i got a swarm of suitors blowing up my crib,
trying to press my mom to pick a new hubby.
instead of going back to her dad’s house for a legit arrangement,
they all vibe here daily, slashing up my cattle, guzzling my wine,
living rent-free, basically bleeding my inheritance.
i’d fight if i could, but i’m not about that warrior life.
so i’m begging you, have a heart, do something, or at least feel cringe about it.
fear the gods who might clap back at your shady vibes.
if my dad wronged somebody, fine, punish me in revenge.
but i’d rather you just eat all my goods openly,
so at least i can call you out in public and get some payback.
right now, you’re just draining me with zero accountability.”

he flings the scepter to the ground, tears up.
the whole crowd is big sad, hush falling.
finally, antinous, suitor alpha with major attitude, claps back:
“yo telemachus, talk about triggered. you’re pinning blame on us,
but your mom’s the real baddie here—
she’s been playing mind games for three whole years.
straight up weaving that funeral shroud for laertes by day,
secretly unraveling it by night, telling us ‘just wait till i finish weaving.’
time passes, we get scammed, until a snitch maid told us the truth.
we caught her unweaving at night—finessed again.

“so here’s our hot take: either send your mom home to her daddy,
let him marry her off properly with big bride gifts,
or she can keep messing with your head,
draining your estate while we just vibe.
we’re not leaving till she picks a man, best believe.
this might give her a rep for ~eternal cunning~ or whatever,
but your wallet? it’s taking massive l’s.
so yeah, your move.”

telemachus shoots back:
“dude, i can’t forcibly evict my own mom, that’s savage and my grandpa would kill me,
plus i'd catch major flak from the entire region.
so no, i won’t do that. if you got half a brain, bounce.
stop feasting on my dime. or i swear, i’ll call in the gods.
zeus can bring down some cosmic ratio on y’all.”

boom—just then, a pair of eagles swoops overhead, swirling in tandem,
then dive-bombs the crowd, clawing at heads, an omen of meltdown.
halitherses, an old prophet who’s basically the eagle hype-man, says,
“listen up, y’all. that’s a sign from above: odysseus is near,
and these suitors are about to catch a big l.
you better stop or it’s curtains for everyone.
i predicted before he left for troy that he’d come back after many struggles,
year twenty, no less. that time is now, so watch yourselves.”

eurymachus roasts him:
“bro, keep your so-called prophecy to yourself.
odysseus is deader than dead, and your tea is stale.
go lecture your own kids at home, not us.
we suitors don’t fear telemachus or your silly omens,
and we sure won’t stop munching that free buffet.
penelope either weds or we keep the party going.”

telemachus stands up:
“enough. clearly you’re all about that mooch life.
just give me a ship and some crew, i’m out to find news of my dad.
maybe i’ll get some word from menelaus or nestor, or catch rumor from the gods.
if i find out he’s alive, i’ll keep waiting. if not, i’ll come home,
build him a tomb, do the funeral rites, and let mom pick a new man.”

mentor (the real one, ody’s old friend) speaks next, complaining nobody’s stepping up for tele.
some jerk named leocritus retorts:
“bro, if odysseus himself came back, he’d just get stomped by all of us suitors.
you talk nonsense. so let’s dismiss this assembly. telemachus?
he’ll never leave ithaca. done deal.”

the meeting ends, suitors bounce back to ody’s palace.
telemachus, however, quietly hits the shoreline,
washes his hands in the salty wave, prays to athena:
“help me out, goddess. you told me to sail off, but these suitors are blocking me.”

athena, disguised as mentor again, pops up:
“tele, no stress. if you’ve got your dad’s hustle, you’ll pull this off.
go gather your provisions—wine in jars, barley in bags, all hush-hush.
i’ll round up a volunteer squad, snag the best ship,
and we’ll dip at night before the suitors catch on.”

feeling hype, telemachus goes home. suitors are still butchering goats,
living their best loot-goblin life. antinous tries to smooth-talk tele,
like “hey buddy, come feast, chill, no harsh words.
we might even get you a ship if you ask nice.”
telemachus is like, “lol no. you guys mooched enough. i’m grown now,
i might just pull something savage. watch.”

they clown him behind his back:
“he’s def planning some wild quest or poison from ephyr.
wouldn’t put it past him to slip it in the wine.”
others joke he’ll vanish at sea like his dad.

telemachus, ignoring them, sneaks into the stash room.
he meets eurycleia, best nanny ever,
and instructs her, “fill up twelve jars with that prime wine you keep for odysseus’s hypothetical return,
measure out barley into leather sacks, keep it on the dl.
i’m bouncing to pylos/sparta for father intel.
don’t spill the beans to mom for at least ten, maybe twelve days,
so i can be safely gone.”
the old nurse freaks out, weeping, but tele’s like, “trust me, the gods got me.”
she swears to keep quiet and preps the goods.

athena flits around town disguised as telemachus, recruiting a savage crew.
she borrows a swift boat from noemon, sets up at the harbor’s edge,
stocks it with gear, calls the volunteer homies.
sundown arrives, and she puts the suitors to sleep early,
making them super drowsy so they knock out all over town.
then she calls telemachus aside:
“yo, it’s go-time, bestie. your squad’s waiting on the beach.”

they hurry down, find the men at the boat.
“load up the supplies,” telemachus says. “mom doesn’t know, so let’s keep it low-key.”
they stash everything onboard, tele and athena climbing in,
loose the cables, sit at the oars.
athena sends a sweet tailwind, a fresh zesty breeze across the wine-dark sea.
the crew hoists the mast, sets the sails,
and the boat slices through the waves with that pleasing hush.
they pour some wine out for the deathless gods—
especially big ups to grey-eyed athena—
and ride the ocean all night till dawn.
