yap at me muse, 'cause telemachus & his boy peisistratus cruise on to sparta,
where menelaus, golden-haired big shot, is partying hard
celebrating two weddings at once, no cap:
his daughter hooking up with achilles’s kid (that promise from troy, fr),
and his own son megapenthes (he had him by a slave bae—helen didn’t conceive anymore, bruh)
tying the knot with a local shorty.

the place is glam, decked out like the sun or the moon or something,
everyone living for the banquet vibe, hearing a pro bard jam out,
while dancers do flips in the middle of the hall, big w energy.

tele & peisi park their horses by the front, and a doorman named eteoneus sees 'em,
asks menelaus, “yo, boss, should we let these dudes in or send them to motel 6?”
menelaus is scandalized: “bruh, do we not remember how we used to eat other folks’ free feasts?
are we savage? unhook their horses and bring ‘em in for dinner asap.”

so the staff does exactly that, hooking the steeds up with fancy feed,
and lead the visitors into menelaus’s palace, which is shining like literal stardust.
tele & peisi are shook by the visuals—like, this is olympus vibes.
then they get that essential spa day, a swirl in fancy tubs, fresh oil rub, new fits.
they sit next to menelaus, who goes, “fam, dig in first, then we’ll talk.”

they munch succulent beef & sip wine in gold cups.
once they’re stuffed, menelaus checks them: “so who are y’all?
clearly not peasants—some big-daddy lineage must be in your dna.”

telemachus leans over to peisi, like “omg this place is so loaded, it’s shining like peak z e u s – t i n g.”
menelaus overhears and laughs: “buddy, i’ve traveled a ton and stacked wealth,
but none of it soothes the heartbreak i carry over losing my bros at troy and being triple-crossed afterward.
especially your dad, odysseus, who was next-level cunning, always hustling for me.
nobody had it rougher than him—my heartbreak is endless. penelope, laertes, telemachus (that’s you, ironically) must be missing him so bad.”

he says that, and telemachus starts to tear up. menelaus clocks it, wonders if he should mention ody’s name or wait.
just then, helen emerges from her fancy high-ceiling bedroom, goddess-tier looks, flanked by her maids and carrying her personal golden distaff.
she sees telemachus and is like, “holy guac, menelaus, that kid is the spitting image of odysseus. bet he’s telemachus, right?”

menelaus is like, “dang, i see it too. that face, that hair, those eyes.”
peisistratus confirms: “yep, he’s tele. but he was shy to mention his famous father and your bond.
my dad nestor sent me to escort him; we need your big-brain vibes.”

menelaus’s heart swells: “no way, i can’t believe this is odysseus’s boy. i used to dream we’d be besties forever,
but the gods had other plans, leaving him lost at sea. i mourn him every day.”
they all cry: helen, menelaus, telemachus, even peisi recalling his own bro antilochus who died in troy. big meltdown.

menelaus is like, “this is too sad. let’s ease up and feast. tomorrow we can talk all the tragedy we want.”
a servant pours water for hand-washing, they get back to dinner.
but helen has her own trick: she drops a special herb in the wine that erases sorrow, making folks forget their woes—straight up magic.
the party mellows, everyone vibes again.

helen starts storytime: “yo, let me tell you about your dad’s savage feats at troy. man literally disguised himself, took a beating so it looked real,
then snuck into the city. i recognized him anyway, gave him a bath and new clothes, sworn to secrecy.
he killed a bunch of trojans and brought back intel. i was homesick, so i kinda cheered him on, not gonna lie.”

menelaus picks up: “facts, ody was unstoppable. remember that trojan horse stunt?
he was inside with all the best achaeans, and you, helen, walked around calling out names in the voices of our wives.
antinous (another soldier) almost answered, but odysseus clamped his mouth. saved us all.
dude was unstoppable.”

tele sighs: “dang, so epic, but it didn’t save him from heartbreak. i guess the gods had him pegged for extra sorrow.”
anyway, the night goes on, menelaus sets them up with fancy bedding.
they knock out. next morning, menelaus meets telemachus: “so what’s up? business or personal quest?”

tele is real: “i’m searching for news about my dad, sir. my house is swarmed by suitors. it’s ugly. help me, please.”
menelaus, face dark, goes: “they dare attempt such stunts in ody’s place?
he’s 100% that lion about to pounce. i wish i could see him mow them down.
anyway, let me share what i learned from the old man of the sea, proteus, who i trapped in egypt.

“the gist: i was stuck in egypt ‘cause i forgot to do the proper sacrifices before sailing.
this sea-god’s daughter, eidothea, took pity on me, gave me a cunning plan:
we disguised ourselves in smelly seal-skins, ambushed proteus at his naptime.
he shapeshifted into a lion, snake, leopard, water, tree—did all that glitchy boss-phase nonsense,
but we held tight, so eventually he gave up, asked what i wanted.
i said i needed my route home, plus news of my pals.
he told me: ‘ajax died at sea, poseidon wrecked him.
your brother agamemnon got murdered by that scumbag aegisthus, though eventually orestes avenged him.
odysseus is alive but captive on calypso’s island, pining. no ship or crew.
menelaus, you yourself won’t die in argos but get whisked to elysium because you married helen, child of zeus. no storms for you, bruh.’

“i then finished my sacrifices in egypt, finally got home, though i’m forever scarred by how many homies we lost.
but hey, telemachus, stay here with me for a good while, let me lavish you with gifts.
i got horses, a fancy chariot, and a dope silver mixing bowl with gold rims.”

tele is polite but declines the horses: “eh, ithaca’s rocky goatland, not really for horses.
let me have a souvenir of a different kind. then i gotta bounce; my crew is waiting.”
menelaus is impressed: “dang, you speak with your father’s wisdom. i’ll hook you up with a fine shining treasure—
maybe that silver bowl with gold trim made by hephaestus. total flex.”

meanwhile, back in ithaca, the suitors keep partying, doing sports in the courtyard,
led by antinous and eurymachus.
noemon, a local, strolls up: “yo, antinous, do you know when telemachus is back with my ship? i kinda need it.”
they’re shocked. “wait, telemachus left?? for pylos/sparta?? wth??”
so they realize tele’s gone behind their backs, gather in ody’s hall, raging about how he slipped away.
antinous rants: “let’s ambush him at sea. we’ll murder him in the strait between ithaca and samos.”
everyone nods—dark times. they prep a swift vessel, pick 20 guys to do the dirty job, row out to lay the trap.

penelope eventually hears the rumors from medon, the herald: “the suitors plan to kill your son.”
she collapses in grief: “dang, i lost odysseus, now telemachus is next?? the gods really gave me maximum sorrow.”
the old nurse eurycleia tries to console her: “don’t worry too much, dear queen. tele took supplies from me and swore me to hush. pray to athena—maybe she’ll protect him.”
penelope, heart pounding, prays upstairs to athena for telemachus’s safe return.

the suitors sail off and set up an ambush near a rocky isle called asteris, waiting to assassinate tele.
but penelope tosses sleeplessly, weighed down by fear—finally falling into a sorrowful doze.
athena sends a dream figure in the shape of pen’s sister, iphthime, to calm her: “don’t worry, tele is guarded by a goddess. trust that.”
penelope begs for news of ody, but the dream shade is like, “too uncertain to say.” then it vanishes on the breeze.

the suitors stay posted in ambush, thirsting for tele’s blood, as menelaus and telemachus feast in sparta, the story continuing...
