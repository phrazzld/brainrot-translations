yo so there's this random beggar dude named irus (government name: arnaios) who be roamin’ ithaca,
always lookin’ to secure a big munch—honestly a total chow fiend.
dude’s tall but legit has zero muscle or fighting skill, just major appetite vibes.
he sees odysseus (still disguised in rags) squat outside the palace door
and he’s like, “wtf gramps, you can’t squat here, bounce or i’ll boot you.”

odysseus side-eyes him: “dude, i’m not messing with you. we can share the porch,
no need for drama. also you’re def a fellow beggar, so maybe don’t gatekeep?
and watch yourself, ‘cause old man or not, i might have to humble you if you test me.”
but irus is super triggered, talking all tough: “step aside or catch these hands,
i’ll smash your teeth out, turn you into ground pork.”

they start posturing by the doorway. antinoos notices, cracks up,
and rallies the suitors: “yo squad, we got a ring match—ursus poor vs. broke boy,
popcorn time.” all the suitors gather ‘round, dying to see these bums scrap.
antinoos is all, “check it: we got goats roasting for dinner, so whichever beggar wins
gets a seat at our table daily, no more broke bros allowed after that.”

odysseus pretends to be all like, “i’m old, battered, not hype for fighting.
but i gotta do what i gotta do—just swear nobody else’ll jump me from behind.”
they all vow, “sure, 1v1 only.” telemachus chimes in, “fear not, father—erm, i mean stranger—
nobody in this house will cheap-shot you. we got you.”

odysseus, playing the long con, ties up his rags, flexes them quads and shoulders.
athena lowkey buffs him, so he’s jacked under the tatty clothes.
the suitors are like, “damn, where’d that old man get them gains?”
iris sees those muscles and freaks out, but the suitors drag him forward,
telling him, “bro, if you lose, we’ll ship you to king echetos who tortures losers, so fight.”

odysseus thinks, “should i just knock his skull off or go easy?” then decides just to one-punch him,
so he taps irus’s jaw—*snap*, blood sprays, teeth go flying, dude collapses in the dust, out cold.
everyone roars with laughter. odysseus drags him by the foot to the courtyard and is like,
“chill here, guard the pigs and dogs, and don’t big-dog random strangers again.”
then odysseus re-enters, to a chorus of suitors praising him: “well done, man, you ended that pest.”

antinoos gifts him a big tray of meat, amphinomus hands him bread and wine.
odysseus thanks amphinomus, then warns him, “bro, these suitors are doin’ dirty deeds,
and i sense odysseus will return soon. maybe skip town if you’re wise.”
amphinomus feels uneasy but stays anyway, ‘cause athena’s already put doom on his schedule.

now athena’s like, “hmm, let’s get penelope to stir the pot.”
she sprinkles penelope with some goddess-level glam while pen is napping,
making her taller, glowy, basically extra slay, so the suitors drool more and drive the tension up.
penelope wakes, wonders why she’s so polished, then heads downstairs with her squad of maids,
posts up, and scolds telemachus for letting the beggar get smacked around.

telemachus is like, “mom, i tried, but these suitors do what they want. also that beggar knocked out irus,
so that’s not on me.” penelope drags on about how if odysseus were here, nobody would dare.
eurymachus tries simping: “queen pen, you so fine, men from all over the region would be here if they saw you.”
penelope’s like, “i used to be cuter before the gods took my hubby away to troy.
anyway, if you want to court me, you gotta bring me gifts. not mooch off odysseus’s estate.”

the suitors are all, “fair, we’ll shower you with presents.” they each hand off some fancy gifts—
like a dope embroidered robe from antinoos, a gold necklace from eurymachus, and so on.
penelope heads back upstairs with her new loot, the suitors party on with music and dancing,
killing time till evening. once night hits, they light torches.

odysseus stands by the torches, shining them around. he sees the maids messing about,
some being rude—melantho especially, who’s eurymachus’s side-chick.
she snipes at odysseus: “why you still here, old creep? better watch out.”
odysseus is like, “shut your mouth, or i’ll tell telemachus to cut you down.”
she and the other maids scurry off, freaked out.

athena still won’t let the suitors behave, wanting odysseus to burn with more rage.
eurymachus stands up, mocking odysseus: “haha, shiny bald old man, want a job in the fields?”
odysseus fires back: “buddy, i’d outrun and outfight you any day if i had my gear.
you’re tough talk in a crowd of losers. better pray odysseus doesn’t roll through or you’ll be first to bounce.”
eurymachus flips, hurls a wine cup at odysseus—he ducks, it hits the floor with a crash.

everything’s about to pop off, but telemachus intervenes: “guys, you’re hammered. cut it out, go home.
stop messing up my dad’s house.” they all bite their lips in frustration but can’t argue.
amphinomus (the calmer one) is like, “y’all, let’s just do a final toast to the gods and bounce.”
so the herald pours wine, they do a quick libation, then each suitor stumbles off to their own bed.
