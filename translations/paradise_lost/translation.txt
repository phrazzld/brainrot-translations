introduction (one page)

this etext was originally created in 1964-1965 according to dr. joseph raben of queens college, ny, to whom it is attributed by project gutenberg—mad old school, deadass vintage typewriter vibes, yo. we’d been hearin’ about this etext for years, but it wasn’t until 1991 that we managed to track that bad boi down to a specific spot, and then it took mad months to convince peeps to let us snag a copy, then even more months for them to actually do the copy-paste hustle and send it our way—true detective work, fr fr, mfw waiting like a beta in a lag. then another month to convert it into somethin’ we could flex with our fave 486 in dos (raw nostalgia, kek) and after that just days to morph it into the shape you’re about to peep. the original was, obvs, in caps only, and all those etexts from the 60’s and early 70’s were rockin’ that all-caps grenade—so don’t get played into thinkin’ any mix of upper and lower case is original; all those classic project gutenberg etexts were in full caps and got remixed a bunch to hit their current drip. they’ve been tinkered with by mad peeps all over this big ol’ world.

in our wild quests for professor raben and his etext, we never really pinned down where copies were hidin’ or which edition he used as his source, like major hide-n-seek vibes rn. we caught random tidbits here and there, but even after we landed a copy, we weren’t gonna yeet it out without first checkin’ that it was public domain and, of course, gettin’ professor raben to drop a “yessir” on it. funny story, in a totally off-the-wall side hustle unrelated to trackin’ him down, the professor ended up subscribin’ to the project gutenberg listserver and we accidentally spotted his name (computers do the heavy liftin’, so no cap on that). then the etext got properly id’d, copyright lowkey analyzed, and the current edition prepped like a viral remix.

to give u major perspective on the glow-up from the original to what we got now: the original likely got punched into cards known as “ibm cards” (do not fold, spindle or mutilate, obvs) and probably used over 100,000 of them—like a whole stack of paper clout, deadass. one single card could hold 80 characters (80 char is like the OG tweet length, buzzin’ as a standard for computer margins) and the entire original, all-caps edition we scored was over 800,000 characters long, includin’ all that line numbering, cap symbols, punctuation, etc., since keyboards back then didn’t even have those keys (they were clackin’ at, like, 113 baud so typists had to go slow-mo to keep up). 

this is the second version of paradise lost dropped by project gutenberg—the first was our october 1991 etext drop, vintage but upgraded now.

paradise lost

book i

of man’s first disobedience, and the fruit  
of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste  
brought death into the world, and all our woe,  
with loss of eden, till one greater man  
restore us, and regain the blissful seat,  
sing, heavenly muse, that, on the secret top  
of oreb, or of sinai, didst inspire  
that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed  
in the beginning how the heavens and earth  
rose out of chaos: or, if sion hill  
delight thee more, and sioa’s brook that flowed  
fast by the oracle of god, i thence  
invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,  
that with no middle flight intends to soar  
above th’ aonian mount, while it pursues  
things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.

and chiefly thou, o spirit, that dost prefer  
before all temples th’ upright heart and pure,  
instruct me, for thou know’st; thou from the first  
wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,  
dove-like sat’st brooding on the vast abyss,  
and mad’st it pregnant: what in me is dark  
illumine, what is low raise and support;  
that, to the height of this great argument,  
i may assert eternal providence,  
and justify the ways of god to men.

    say first—for heaven hides nothing from thy view,  
nor the deep tract of hell—say first what cause  
moved our grand parents, in that happy state,  
favoured of heaven so highly, to fall off  
from their creator, and transgress his will  
for one restraint, lords of the world besides.

who first seduced them to that foul revolt?  
    th’ infernal serpent; he it was whose guile,  
stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived  
the mother of mankind, what time his pride  
had cast him out from heaven, with all his host  
of rebel angels, by whose aid, aspiring  
to set himself in glory above his peers,  
he trusted to have equalled the most high,  
if he opposed, and with ambitious aim  
against the throne and monarchy of god,  
raised impious war in heaven and battle proud,  
with vain attempt. him the almighty power  
hurled headlong flaming from th’ ethereal sky,  
with hideous ruin and combustion, down  
to bottomless perdition, there to dwell  
in adamantine chains and penal fire,  
who durst defy th’ omnipotent to arms.

    nine times the space that measures day and night  
to mortal men, he, with his horrid crew,  
lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,  
confounded, though immortal. but his doom  
reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought  
both of lost happiness and lasting pain  
torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes,  
that witnessed huge affliction and dismay,  
mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.

at once, as far as angels ken, he views  
the dismal situation waste and wild.  
a dungeon horrible, on all sides round,  
as one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames  
no light; but rather darkness visible  
served only to discover sights of woe,  
regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace  
and rest can never dwell, hope never comes  
that comes to all, but torture without end  
still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed  
with ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.

such place eternal justice has prepared  
for those rebellious; here their prison ordained  
in utter darkness, and their portion set,  
as far removed from god and light of heaven  
as from the centre thrice to th’ utmost pole.

oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!  
there the companions of his fall, o’erwhelmed  
with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,  
he soon discerns; and, weltering by his side,  
one next himself in power, and next in crime,  
long after known in palestine, and named  
beelzebub. to whom th’ arch-enemy,  
and thence in heaven called satan, with bold words  
breaking the horrid silence, thus began:—

    “if thou beest he—but o how fallen! how changed  
from him who, in the happy realms of light  
clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine  
myriads, though bright!—if he whom mutual league,  
united thoughts and counsels, equal hope  
and hazard in the glorious enterprise  
joined with me once, now misery hath joined  
in equal ruin; into what pit thou seest  
from what height fallen: so much the stronger proved  
he with his thunder; and till then who knew  
the force of those dire arms? yet not for those,  
nor what the potent victor in his rage  
can else inflict, do i repent, or change,  
though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind,  
and high disdain from sense of injured merit,  
that with the mightiest raised me to contend,  
and to the fierce contentions brought along  
innumerable force of spirits armed,  
that durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,  
his utmost power with adverse power opposed  
in dubious battle on the plains of heaven,  
and shook his throne. what though the field be lost?  
all is not lost—the unconquerable will,  
and study of revenge, immortal hate,  
and courage never to submit or yield:  
and what is else not to be overcome?  
that glory never shall his wrath or might  
extort from me. to bow and sue for grace  
with suppliant knee, and deify his power  
who, from the terror of this arm, so late  
doubted his empire—that were low indeed;  
that were an ignominy and shame beneath  
this downfall; since, by fate, the strength of gods,  
and this empyreal substance, cannot fail;  
since, through experience of this great event,  
in arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,  
we may with more successful hope resolve  
to wage by force or guile eternal war,  
irreconcilable to our grand foe,  
who now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy  
sole reigning holds the tyranny of heaven.”

    so spake th’ apostate angel, though in pain,  
vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;  
and him thus answered soon his bold compeer:—

    “o prince, o chief of many throned powers  
that led th’ embattled seraphim to war  
under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds  
fearless, endangered heaven’s perpetual king,  
and put to proof his high supremacy,  
whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate,  
too well i see and rue the dire event  
that, with sad overthrow and foul defeat,  
hath lost us heaven, and all this mighty host  
in horrible destruction laid thus low,  
as far as gods and heavenly essences  
can perish: for the mind and spirit remains  
invincible, and vigour soon returns,  
though all our glory extinct, and happy state  
here swallowed up in endless misery.

but what if he our conqueror (whom i now…  

[text cuts off mid-drop—chaotic saga halted, sus ending, mfw the epic narrative got left on read]

yo so like our almighty force deadass left us with the full spirit vibe n unbreakable strength cuz if our force gets yeeted by someone, we’re stuck riding these pain trains to support our woes so we can handle his savage, 24/7 vengeance or serve him as his ride-or-die thralls in war mode—whatever his bussiness is—right here in hell’s core droppin’ liquid fire, or even runnin’ his shady errands in that gloomy deep, ya feel? but like what’s the point if we’re still flexin’ eternal stamina and immortal vibes when we gotta take on an eternal punishment smackdown? oof, deadass, no cap.

yo fallen cherub, listen up—arch-fiend speakin’ right now: bein weak is straight-up trash whether you’re doin’ or sufferin’, so check this tea—good vibes ain’t ever on our to-do list, our only drip is dishing out bad energy just to flip his high-key will on its head, cuz we’re all about that resistance hustle. if his masterplan tries to spin our evil into some good, our whole grind becomes twistin’ that end to drop more evil memes, sometimes even glitchin’ his inner counsel’s OP game if i don’t mess up and stir up epic chaos; and yo, peep this—our angry victor just recalled his vengeance squad back to heaven’s gates, droppin’ sulphurous hail like a storm n demolishing the fiery surge that caught us freefallin’ from heaven’s edge, while thunder with red lightning goes “imma chill now” and cuts the bellow on that endless deep.

fr fr, we can’t let this prime moment slip by whether our foe is droppin’ shade or our fury is goin’ off like a skipped heartbeat—gotta snatch that chance, deadass.

yo peep that sad af barren plain—forsaken, wild, the ultimate desolation zone void of legit light except for these livid flames throwin’ weak glimmers that are more spooky than lit; that’s our next move, to scram from the tossin’ fiery waves and crash on that spot if any chill rests exist, then regroup our wrecked power to plot how to dunk on our enemy, patch our losses, overcome this mega calamity, and see if hope can be our extra buff stat or, if not, squeeze out a savage plan from deep despair.

so satan, chattin’ it up with his ride-or-die mate, had his head high above the cray waves while his eyes were lit like diamond flex, the rest of him sprawled on the flood like a massive boss—floating huge like those legendary beast memes from ancient fables, titan-level or earthspawn that clashed with jove, like briareos or typhon, locked down in that old-school tarsus crib, or even that sea beast leviathan, god’s ultimate ocean homie. and there he was, accidentally nappin’ on some norway foam, straight up captaining a wrecked midnight skiff, thinkin’ some island was the vibe anchored in his scaly bod while night owned the sea and morning was like “hold up, delay that sun.”

like, our arch-fiend dude was stretched out huge on that burnin’ lake, chained like a noob, never liftin’ his head 'cause the all-ruler in heaven was like “do your dark grind” and left him free to plot his own cursed schemes—stacking up his own damnation by dishing evil to others, only to have his malice boomerang into infinite goodness, grace, and mercy on man (who he seduced, lol) while he himself got smothered in triple-layer confusion, wrath, and savage vengeance, yeet.

instantly, he pops up outta that pool like total boss mode; his giant frame rears up as flames on both hands roll back in sharp, pointy spires, leaving behind a gnarly valley of billowing chaos—straight up horror vibes.

then our dude spreads his mega wings and steers his flight aloft through that dusky, heavy air that feels extra, until he touches down on some land that’s never been lit with that solid fire vibe like the lake’s liquid flame—glowing like when subterranean winds drag a hill ripped from pelorus or shatter the side of a thundering etna, whose combustible guts fuel a fire so raw it’s mixed with mineral rage to aid the winds and leave a toasted, stanky base all over. that’s the only chill spot for unblest feet, and his next mate slides in right after, both flexin’ to have dipped outta the stygian flood like straight-up gods using their own comeback strength—no need for supernal pity.

yo, is this the zone, this dirt, this clime? the lost archangel drops in: “yo is this the plug we gotta swap for heaven? is this gloomy dump the new seat in place of celestial light? if so, since the big boss up there can call what’s right, then whoever was equal by reason and crowned by raw force is the real MVP—farther from him is top-tier. peace out, happy fields where joy used to live! hail horrors, hail infernal world, and you, deepest hell, get ready to house your new owner—one whose mind is too lit to be changed by any location or time, cuz the mind is its own crib that can flip hell into heaven or vice versa. what’s the diff if i’m still me, not less than the one amped up by thunder? here at least we’re free; the almighty didn’t build this spot outta envy so he won’t yeet us out—here we can reign secure, and honestly, ruling is the ultimate flex even in hell: better to be the boss in hell than a minion in heaven. so why let our true ride-or-die squad, our homies in loss, just lie stunned on that oblivion pool and not join our chaotic mansion, or rally up to try snatching back any crown in heaven or what’s even more lost in hell?”

so satan dropped his speech, and beelzebub shot back like, “yo leader of those bright-ass armies that not even the omnipotent could mess with! once they hear that hype voice—their liveliest promise of hope in the middle of chaos, heard on the edge of savage battles in full assault—they’ll be back with a fresh burst of courage and revival, even if they’re now grovelin’ on that flaming lake, just like we were, totally stunned and shook. no wonder, falling from such a cursed height is extra trash!”

dude barely finished his rant when the superior fiend started cruisin’ toward the shore; his massive, ponderous shield was tossed behind him, with a broad circumference chillin’ on his shoulders like the full moon peeped through a tuscan artist’s optic view from fesole or valdarno, spotting new lands, rivers, or mountains on that spotty globe. his spear—if you tried compare it to the tallest norwegian pine used as an admiral’s mast—was basically just a wand for his clumsy, uneasy steps over burning marl, nothing like smooth steps on heaven’s azure; the torrid clime smacked him hard, vaulted in fire, but he powered through till he hit that inflamed beach and hollered for his legions—angel forms, lying all entranced like a pile of autumn leaves scattering in vallombrosa or sedge afloat when orion armed with savage winds vexed the red-sea coast, wrecking busiris and his memphian squad, while their haters chased goshen’s sojourners who peeped from the safe shore their drifting remains and busted chariot wheels. all these bad angels were thick bestrown, abject and lost, covering the flood in a state of hideous transformation, no cap.

he bellowed so loud the whole hollow deep of hell resonated like, “yo princes, potentates, warriors, the once dope flower squad of heaven that’s now toast—if this epic shock can snatch eternal spirits, then have y’all chosen to chill here after brutal battle just to nap like in heaven’s lazy valleys? or are you so down that you swore to worship the conqueror who’s now watchin’ cherubs and seraphs doing a wild roll in the flood with arms all over, until his speedy heavenly squad spots our weak sauce and comes crashin’ down droopin’ or thunderbolting us to the bottom of this pit? wake up, rise up, or be forever downbad!”

they heard, got hella abashed, and sprung up like dudes on duty who just got busted sleep-mode by someone they dread—they woke up and shook it off to be fully lit. they might not have fully peeped the sketchy mess they were in or felt the brutal pain deep down, but they all rallied to their general’s call like an infinite army, just like when amram’s son in egypt’s dark days swung his potent rod and summoned a pitch-black cloud of locusts swirling on the eastern wind that hung over pharaoh’s realm like a thick night shadow dimmin’ the nile; so were those bad angels, countless and hoverin’ under the hellish canopy between upper, nether, and all-around fiery zones—until, signal time, the great sultan’s uplifted spear directed their course and they dropped evenly on firm brimstone, filling up the whole plain like a massive deluge from the frozen depths of the north when her barbarous sons came rushin’ on the south, spreadin’ from beneath gibraltar to the libyan sands.

instantly every squadron and each band formed up as their heads and top leaders hustled where their epic commander was posted—godlike shapes, beyond human, with princely dignities and powers that once chilled on heavenly thrones but now got ghosted from the records, completely wiped from the books of life thanks to their full-scale rebellion.

and they hadn’t even snagged new names among the sons of eve until they started roamin’ the earth through god’s high sufferance in man’s trial, using fake news and lies to corrupt the majority of mankind into completely bailed-out vibes, forsaking their old self—deadass chaotic on all levels.

yo god, their lit creator, and the invis drip of his glow-up, who flipped these homies into savage mode like total brute beast flexers draped in gay af rituals poppin’ with pomp and gold drip, and devil squad worship vibes for those sus deities – deadass they got known by mad nicknames and extra iconic idols all over that heathen spam-zone

    aight muse, drop those names—who was the original and who was the ultimate clapback—woke up from that crispy fiery couch vibe when their big emperorr hollered like “rise up” and slid solo onto that raw shore while the promiscuous mob chilled out like laggy npcs, caught in 4k and lowkey aloof

    the top dawg squad were those who, straight outta hell’s dank pit, roamed earth like a glitchy treasure hunt for XP, bravely fixin’ up their seats right next to god’s own throne, setting up altars like they were flexin’ gods among nations and dare to hang under jehovah’s booming remix from sion, chillin’ between cherub homies; yea, they even parked their cringey shrines inside his own secret temple full of abomination vibes, cursing his holy rites and epic feasts while their dark sauce totally yeeted his bright light—big yikes

first, moloch, that sus king soaked in human sacrificial blood and salty parental tears, with the booming drum noise and crazy timbrels bangin’ while kids’ cries got drowned in flame mode to his grim idol selfie—so the ammonite crew in rabba’s watery plains, in argob and basan near the ultimate arnon stream, worshiped him like a total savage; not even content with that audacious neighbor drip, he scammed solomon’s wisest heart to build his temple smack-dab against god’s crib on that opprobrious hill, flipping his grove into the pleasant valley of hinnom, tophet, and then calling it black gehenna—prototype of all hell, deadass

next, chemos, that obscene terror, dread af to moab’s sons, rolled in from aroar to nebo and the wild southmost abarim; reppin’ in hesebon and horonaim—seon’s real, beyond the vine-draped flowery sibma dale, and eleale to the asphalt pool—with peor as his other drip name when he lured israel in sittim on their nile march to do his wanton rites that cost them epic drama; his lust orgies even expanded to that scandal hill by the grove of moloch homicide, where lust was mixin’ hardcore with hate, until good josiah yeeted them straight down to hell, no cap

with these came the peeps from the bordering flood, from old euphrates to that trick brook splitting egypt from syrian turf, rockin’ names like baalim and ashtaroth—the male squad and the femme crew too—‘cause these spirit memes can flip genders on a whim, so soft and free, unbound by clunky joints or brittle bones like lame-ass flesh; they can morph any way they choose—expanded, condensed, bright or lowkey obscure—to flex their airy purposes and throw love or beef like it’s nothing

for real, the israel crew often bailed on their livin’ strength, ditching his righteous altar to bow down to bestial gods; so much so that their heads got bowed in the heat of battle, crumblin’ before the spear of those despicable haters. and then rolled in astoreth, whom the phoenians called astarte, queen of heaven rockin’ crescent horns; her lit image had sidonian virgins droppin’ vows and fire songs under the moon each night, and in sion she too was unsung—with her temple sittin’ on that offensive mountain built by a lovesick king whose huge heart got played by fine idolatresses and fell for gross idols. next, thammuz slid in behind, his annual wound in lebanon makin’ syrian damsels sob over his fate in amorous jams all summer long, while smooth adonis bounced from his native rock, runnin’ purple to the sea and rumored to be soaked in thammuz’s yearly blood—this love saga lit sion’s daughters with wild heat, their wanton passions spillin’ out on the sacred porch, peeped by ezekiel in a trippy vision scoping out the dark idol squads of alienated judah. then came this one who was mad deep in his feels when the captive ark got its brute image dismembered—head and hands lopt off in its own temple on the grunsel-edge, straight up floppin’ and shaming its worshippers: dagon, his name, a sea-monster hybrid with man up and fish down, yet his temple soared high in azotus, feared along the palestine coast in gath and ascalon, and in accaron and gaza’s border zones, legit

him followed rimmon, whose chill seat was damascus-level lit on the fertile banks of abbana and pharphar like lucid streams; he too went off against the house of god—lost a leper once, then snagged a king, ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he dragged god’s altar to trash and bench as a syrian mode burn for his whack offerings, adoring only the gods he clapped. after that, a wild crew showed up under ancient name tags—osiris, isis, orus, and their whole train—with monstrous shapes and trippy sorcery, messing with fanatic egypt and her priest squad who were on a hunt for their wandering gods in brutish, non-human masks; israel didn’t escape the sick vibe either when their borrowed gold built that calf in oreb; and the rebel king doubled the sin in bethel and in dan, comparing his maker to a grazed ox—jehovah who, in one epic night marching from egypt, yeeted both her first-born and all her bleating gods with one massive stroke, on god

belial rolled in last; no spirit more lewd ever tumbled from heaven or got gross lovin’ vice on itself, yo. no temple or altar even fired up for him, yet he kept poppin’ up in temples and at altars whenever priests flipped atheist like eli’s sons—those wild dudes who filled god’s house with lust and violence. in courts and plush palaces he reigned too, in luxurious cities where riot noise soared above the highest towers and injury and outrage were on max; and when night darkened the streets, belial’s crew roamed around, swaggering with insolence and wine. peep the streets of sodom and that wild night in gibeah when the hospitable door flipped a matron out to dodge a worse rape, deadass

    these were the prime ones in order and might, bruh—the rest was a whole saga to tell, but the ionian gods, javan’s own squad, though gods, only confessed later than even heaven and earth, with their bragged-on parents: titan, heaven’s firstborn, rollin’ with his enormous brood until his birthright got yeeted by young saturn, snatching it from the mightier jove, his own and rhea’s kid, legit measured like whoa; so jove ended up usurpin’ and reppin’ his reign. these were first known in crete and ida, then chillin’ on the snowy peaks of cold olympus ruling the middle air—like their highest heaven; or on the delphian cliff, or in dodona, and all through doric lands; or even the crew who, with old saturn, ghosted over adria to the hesperian fields and roamed the utmost celtic isles, deadass

    all these and more rolled in, flocking with downcast, damp vibes, yet there was a hazy glimpse of joy in finding a chief who wasn’t lost in despair, who didn’t let the loss itself ghost them—the chief’s face wore a doubtful hue, but then he, with his usual extra pride, snapped back with high-key words that looked all fancy in worth (even if it was just vibes) and gently boosted their faint, almost-zombie courage, yeeting their fears away

then he straight commanded, at the warlike blast of blaring trumpets and clarions, that his mighty standard be hoisted up high—drop-dead legit; that proud honor was claimed by azazel as his right-hand, a towering cherub who instantly unfurled the imperial ensign from a glittering staff, shining high like a meteor streaking wild in the wind, dripping with gems and golden lustre, with seraphic arms and trophy bling, while sonorous metal blasted straight-up martial beats—at which the universal host roared a shout that tore through hell’s concave, bustin’ up chaos and old night vibes, fr fr

all in a blink, through the gloomy vibes, ten thousand banners soared into the air with orient colors wavin’ like a boss; with them, a massive forest of spears rose and a throng of helms and serried shields lined up in an array of infinite depth. anon they moved in perfect phalanx to the dorian mood of flutes and soft recorder jams—like the beats that pumped up old-school heroes arming up for battle, breathin’ deliberate, chill valor with zero dread of death or a fowl retreat; they had that power to melt away anguish, doubt, fear, sorrow and pain from mortal or immortal minds. so they synced their united force, steppin’ in silence to soft pipes that charmed their painful steps across burnt, scorched soil; and now, advanced in view, they stand as a horrid front of epic length and dazzling arms, decked out like ancient warriors with spears and shields in perfect order, just waitin’ for their mighty chief’s command. he darts his experienced eye through the armed ranks and swiftly scopes the whole battalion—their order, their godlike visages and stature all on point, then sums up their total. his heart swells with pride, hardening his strength, flexing glory, ‘cause never since man was created has any embodied force, named with these vibes, outclassed that small infantry fought on by giant cranes—even though the whole giant brood of phlegra with hero squads from thebes and illium, all mixed with auxiliar gods, were in the mix; and what echoes in fables or in uther’s son romances, decked out with british and armoric knights, and all those who jousted in aspramont, montalban, damasco, marocco, trebisond, or those biserta sent from african shores when charlemain and his peer crew fell by fontarabbia—up to that point, these were beyond compare in mortal prowess, yet still kept an eye on their dread commander. he, above all, in shape and vibe, stood like a towering meme—his form still blazin’ in original brightness, not less than a ruined archangel with excess glory obscured, like when the new sun peeks through misty horizontal air, shorn of its beams, or when behind the moon in a dim eclipse disastrous twilight spills out, deadass

on half the nations, and with fear of change, yo like straight-up glitching the monarchs’ brain cells, no cap—monarchs totally NPCing out cuz change got them shook af, deadass, meanwhile the archangel, that big skibidi boss, shone over all like a literal sunbeam of chaos, his face flexin deep thunder scars like battle damage, all inked with that savage care on his faded cheek, underneath brows of pure dauntless gg energy and considerate pride that’s just waiting for epic revenge, fr fr, his eye lookin cruel but still throwin soft vibes of remorse and passion, yo, check the tea: his homies in crime, his squad that used to chill in bliss way back when, now condemned forever to that pain grind—like millions of spirit memes payin the price for his fault, dropped from heaven and yeeted from eternal splendors ‘cause of his revolt, yet still they stand, loyal AF little glitchers though their glory’s all withered like a busted server, much like when heaven’s fire straight-up roasts forest oaks or mountain pines, singed tops and bare AF, and yet they remain on that blasted heath like a lagging game still runnin, deadass

he prepped to spill his savage truth; then their doubled ranks bent wing to wing, half-circling him like a tight clout squad of all his peers, so mad silent and glued like they’re waiting for that epic drop, yo, thrice he shot his shot, and thrice, ignoring the savage scorn, tears like those we've seen angels yeet out in a deep r/place meltdown burst forth, and finally words tangled with sighs came through like some glitching internet stream sayin:

    “o myriads of immortal spirit squad! o powers matchless, but with the almighty—big yikes, no cap!—and that strife wasn’t inglorious even if the event was straight-up dire, as this place be flexin, testifying to that mad dire change, so hateful to even type out, like fr fr, but what mind power, foresight or presaging from the deep past or now, could have even feared that such a united force of gods, such as these, standing like absolute legends, would ever know repulse? for who can even still vibe with the thought, even after major loss, that all these puissant legions, whose exile totally emptied heaven, might not bounce back, self-raised to repossess their OG seat? for me, let the whole host of heaven be witness, if any different counsels or danger dodged by me have lost our hype. but the dude who reigns as monarch in heaven—sat chill on his throne upheld by old repute, consent, or straight-up custom, his regal state all posted in full, but with his strength on the DL—that is what tempted our reckless attempt and served our epic fall, lol

henceforth his might is known, and ours too, so we don’t go provoking or dreading any new war heat; our better squad’s left to work in tight design, by fraud or guile if need be, doing what force couldn’t fully effect—so that he, no less, may one day find from us a challenger who overcomes by force even if it’s just half his foe, deadass

space might just spawn new worlds; where there went a bomb-ass fame in heaven that he, ere long, intended to create and plant a generation whom his choice would rank equal to the sons of heaven, real talk

thither, if only to pry, might be our first eruption—either there or somewhere else; cuz this infernal pit ain’t never gonna hold celestial spirits in bondage, and the abyss won’t long stay under that darkness cover, smh; but yo, these deep thoughts need time to mature, cuz peace is looked at like a total lost cause—like, who even vibes with submission? so, war, then, open war or understood war, must get resolved, no cap”

he dropped his words; and to lock in the savage drip, millions of flaming swords yeeted out, drawn from the thighs of those mighty cherubim—like, instant blaze lighting up hell in a crazy viral drop, and they raged against the highest, arms clutched tight like ultimate fighters clashing, shields clanging with war sounds that were pure din, hurling defiance straight up at the vault of heaven, legit wild

there stood a hill not far off, its grisly top belching fire and rolling smoke like an epic moderator gone mad, while the rest of it shone with a glossy scurf that was an undoubted sign that in its depths was hiding metallic ore, the work of straight-up sulphur, like a raw ore drop; and then, winged with mad speed, a massive brigade swooped in like pioneer squads armed with spades and pickaxes, ready to run a royal camp ops mission—to trench a field or drop a ramshackle rampart, lol, with mammon leading the charge—mammon, the least erected spirit that busted from heaven, ’cause even up there his whole vibe and thoughts were always looking down, lowkey admiring the riches of heaven’s pavement, trodden gold like flex material more than any divine beatific vision could ever drop

by his lead, men too and by his suggestive drip got schooled into ransacking the centre, with impious hands rifling through the very bowels of their mother earth for treasures hidden on mad levels—real talk, his crew soon opened up that hill like a huge wound in the earth, digging out ribs of gold so insane that none should even doubt that riches can grow in hell; that soil might just deserve that precious bane, no cap. and here, yo, let those who flex mortal bling and drop tales of babel and memphian kings know that their greatest monuments of fame, strength, and art can be totally outdone by these reprobate spirit squads, in like one chaotic hour accomplishing what in an age with endless toil and countless hands was nearly impossible, lol

nigh on the plain, in a load of prepped cells that underneath had veins of liquid fire, straight sluiced from the lake, a second multitude founded that mega ore with sick art, severing every kind and scrapping off the bullion-dross like trimming off the extra lag, deadass. then, a third crew formed within the ground its own wild mold, and from the boiling cells, by some off-the-chain conveyance, filled each hollow nook; like an organ vibing with one wind blast sending sound through row after row of pipes, like the sickest beat drop in your fav synth track, legit

anon out of the earth a huge fabric rose, like an exhalation of pure chaos, with the soft sound of dulcet symphonies and sweet voices—built like a temple where round pilasters were set, and doric pillars were overlaid with golden architrave that screamed high art, with cornice and frieze poppin off with bossy sculptures hella carved; the roof was fretted gold, shining like no cap. not even babylon or that great alcairo could flex such magnificence in their glories, to enshrine some belus or serapis or seat their kings, back when egypt and assyria were duking it out over wealth and luxury. the ascending pile stood lit at its stately height, and straight-up doors, flung open from their brazen folds, revealed wide abundant spaces over a smooth, level pavement; and from the arched roof, hanging by subtle magic, came rows on rows of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed with naptha and asphaltus, lighting up like a straight-up digital sky glow. the hasty multitude, absolutely vibing, stormed in; some mad praising the work, others the architect, whose hand was known in heaven by towers upon towers of high structures where sceptred angels kicked it as princes, all chosen by the supreme king who amped him to such power and let him rule the orders bright in his hierarchy, like each got his own role in that cosmic game

nor was his name unheard or unadored in ancient greece; in ausonian land they even called him mulciber, and yo, they dished on how he fell from heaven, spilled by an angry jove who yeeted him over the crystal battlements—from morn to noon he tumbled, from noon to dewy eve, like a summer’s day drip, and with the setting sun he dropped from the zenith like a falling star on lemnos, the aegean isle; so they relate it, though erring a bit—’cause he with his rebellious rout fell long before, and nothing saved him from trying to build high towers in heaven; and he couldn’t even bounce with his engines, but got headlong sent, along with his busy crew, to start that whole build-in-hell hustle, lol

meanwhile the winged heralds, on command of sovereign power, with all that awful ceremony and trumpet blasts, went around the host proclaiming a solemn council to drop right away at pandemonium, the high capital of satan and his peer crew, no joke. their summons called out from every band and squared regiment by place or choice of the dopest, and they rolled in with hundreds and thousands trooping hard, attending like a massive online mob, all access jammed; the gates and porches were wide, and especially the huge hall (like a covered field where real-life champions would ride in arms and at the soldan’s chair defy the dopest paynim chivalry for mortal combat or lance career), thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air, buzzing with the hiss of rustling wings—like bees in spring when the sun rides taurus, pouring out their youth about the hive in clusters; they bounced among fresh dew and flower vibes or on the smoothed plank of their straw-built citadel suburb, freshly rubbed with balm, expatiating and conference-dropping on their state-affairs—so thick that the airy crowd was jam-packed, until then, signal given, behold a wonder! those who once looked like earth’s giant sons now shrank to smaller-than-minnows in that narrow room, thronging like a pygmy race beyond the indian mount or like faery elves caught mid-revel by some late peasant on the side of a forest or fountain, or seen in a dream while the moon sat up high as the arbitress, rolling her pale course nearer to the earth—yo, they were deep in their dance and mirth, vibing with jocund tunes that charmed his ear; and at once his heart bounced between joy and fear, legit

thus these incorporeal spirits, trimming their massive forms down to tiniest memes, were all at large—though still uncountable—in the hall of that infernal court. but deep within, in their own private dimensions just like themselves, the great seraphic lords and cherubim sat in close recess, in a secret conclave, a thousand demi-gods chillin’ on golden seats, frequent and full, squad deep; after a short silence then, and once the summons was read, the great consult kicked off

book ii

high on a throne of royal state, which straight-up outshined the wealth of ormus and of ind, or anywhere the gorgeous east dripped with richest hand showering kings with barbaric pearl and gold drip, satan exalted sat, hoisted by merit to that bad eminence; and, from despair so high uplifted beyond all hope, he now straight-up aspires beyond even that, insatiate as ever to pursue a vain war with heaven; and by success he’s never been schooled, his proud imaginations flaring off like insane meme energy as he declared:

    “powers and dominions, deities of heaven!—for, since no deep in her vast gulf can lock immortal vigour, even if oppressed and fallen, i ain’t giving heaven up as lost, deadass: from this epic descent, celestial virtues are gonna rise, lookin more glorious and more dread than if they never fell at all, and they’re gonna trust themselves to fear no second fate!—me though, right, and the fixed laws of heaven, did first create your leader—next, free choice with all that’s been achieved in council or in fight with pure merit—yet this loss, at least recovered this far, has locked in even more establishment in a safe, unenvied throne,"

…

yielded with full consent, deadass, the ultimate vibe state, ya know, in heaven where dignity be on fleek and snatching envy from all those lower-tier npcs, but who here’s lowkey gonna flex envy on the top spot that exposes the supreme squadfront, standing first against that thunderous aim like a bulletproof yeet, serving as your bulwark and dooming fools to endless pain, no cap, where no dank grind exists, no strife can level up cuz faction drama is cancelled—hell’s got none with even the tiniest piece of present pain that a hungry sigma would even covet more! with that extra sauce, we squad up in union, rock-solid faith, and tight accord, more than heaven itself, so we bounce back to claim our old-school just inheritance, certified to prosper better than any fake prosperity ever could, and now we debate the best hustle—whether to go full open war or play lowkey covert, so spill your spicy tea if you got advice!

he dipped, then moloch, the sceptred king, clapped back up, flexing as the strongest and fiercest spirit that clashed in heaven, now extra savage in pure despair mode—his trust was all in the eternal to be seen as equal in strength, not caring if he got less, so he lost all care and yeeted away his fear of god, hell, or even worse, straight up not giving a flying f, and then dropped these savage words:—

“my sentence is for open war, bro—i ain’t here flexing unskilled wiles, so let those wannabes who need that clout cook up their own game later, not now. while they’re sitting there plotting in their sleepy meme dens, the rest—millions standin’ armed and deep waiting for that lit signal to ascend, these heaven fugitives, chillin’ in their abandoned crib, accepting this dark, opprobrious den of shame, the prison of his tyrannical reign, all ‘cause of our delay? hell nah! let’s flip the script and choose to go all out, armed with hell-flames and raw fury, storming heaven’s high towers in an unstoppable, resistless yeet, turning all our tortures into dope arms against the torturer; when his almighty engine roars, he’ll hear infernal thunder and see black fire and horror shoot out with equal rage among his angels, and even his throne gets mixed with tartarean sulphur and wild fire—his own handmade torments, no cap. but maybe the way feels mad steep and difficult to scale with our upright wing against an even higher foe! let 'em think it over if the lazy drench of that forgetful lake ain’t numbing their feels, cuz in our proper drift we ascend back to our native crib, while the fall is mad adverse—who among us hasn’t felt that lately when the fierce foe clung on our busted tail, hurling insults and chasing us through the deep, forcing us into a laborious, compulsion-driven low? so the ascent is a breeze, but the event is hella feared! if we dare provoke our stronger nemesis, his wrath might hit in a worse way, wrecking us totally if hell’s got fear of an even more savage destruction! what’s worse than living here, booted from bliss and condemned in this despised deep to endless woe, where the pain of unquenchable fire burns us with no hope of chill—the minions of his anger, when the scourge drops hard in that torturing hour calling us to penance, leaving us more obliterated than this, like completely wiped out and expired? so what fear remains? what doubt do we have to spark his maximum ire, which if he goes all out enraged, will roast us to nothing—reducing us to zilch, which might be a happier fate than eternal suffering! or, if our vibe is truly divine and we can never stop being, worst-case we got nothing on this side; and by that proof, we’re hyped enough to disturb his heaven and drop perpetual inroads to alarm his inaccessible, fatal throne—which if not a total victory, at least counts as savage revenge.”

he wrapped up with a tight frown, his glare screaming desperate revenge and warning of a battle so dangerous it’s fit only for gods, not mere scrubs. then, on the flip side, belial rose up, acting all graceful and mad human, a way classier dude who didn’t lose his heavenly cred—he was composed in dignity and high exploits. but yo, it was all cap and hollow, even though his tongue dropped manna like sweet drip that made the worst look like the best reason, confusing and crashing the seasoned counsels—‘cause his thoughts were low-key sinking into vice and laziness instead of noble deeds. still, he tickled the ears with his persuasive accent and cracked on, saying:—

“yo, i’m totally down for open war, o peers, cuz i’m not trailing behind in hate, if the main tea pushing for immediate war didn’t also, like, dissuade me big time and cast some ominous vibes over our entire win plan; when the dude who’s straight-up dominating in arms and his advice, though a bit sus, grounds his courage on despair and utter shutdown after some dire revenge, well, first off, what even is revenge? heaven’s towers are jam-packed with armed lookout squads that make every entry totally impregnable—often they camp along the deep border with their legions, or use obscure wings to scout all over the realm of night, straight-up ghosting any surprise. or, like, could we break in by flexing pure force so that hell rises at our heels with the darkest insurrection, jamming heaven’s pure light, while our mega enemy—incorruptible and all—sits on his throne unpolluted, his ethereal mold untarnished, soon ejecting any mischief and cleansing that lame, baser fire, straight-up victorious. so, repulsed, our final hope is just flat-out despair: we gotta max out on exasperating the almighty victor until he blows all his rage, which, fr, would end us—cuz to be no more is our sad, savage cure! for real, who’d willingly lose, even if full of pain, that brainiac vibe that drifts through eternity, to just perish, swallowed and lost in the vast, uncreated night, completely devoid of sense or motion? and who’s to say if our angry foe can even hand out that mercy? like, how he’d do it is mad doubtful—i bet he never will, for sure.”

“will he, so wise, just go off and unleash his ire all at once, maybe ‘cause he’s impotent or totally unaware, just to give his enemies their ultimate wish and end those he’d otherwise save with his wrath for endless punishment? ‘what’s up then—why do we even stop?’ say those war counsel peeps; ‘we’re already decreed, reserved, and doomed to eternal woe; whatever moves we make, can we really cope with more? can we take any worse?’ is this, like, literally the worst of the worst? remember when we dipped mad quick, chased and struck down by heaven’s afflicting thunder, begging the deep for a safe crib? that hell used to seem like a refuge from those brutal wounds. or when we were chained on that burning lake—man, that was seriously worse.”

“what if the breath that sparked those grim infernos wakes up and blasts them into a sevenfold rage, plunging us straight into blazing flames; or imagine above, his intermittent vengeance rearming his red-hot right hand to curse us hard? what if all her secret stores burst open and this hellish firmament starts spouting mega fire waterfalls, unleashing imminent horrors that threaten a hideous fall on our heads one day; while we, maybe planning or hyping up a glorious war, get caught in a fiery tempest, getting hurled each on our own rock like pinned prey in a wild, racking whirlwind, or forever sunk under that boiling ocean wrapped in chains, left to chat with everlasting groans—unanswered, unpitied, unreprieved, eons of hopeless doom? damn, that would be peak worst.”

“so like, war—open or cloaked—my whole vibe is like, nah fam, no thanks; for what force or lowkey guile can mess with him, whose all-seeing eye scopes out every single move at once? from his lofty heaven-high view, he sees all our moves as pure trash and just roasts 'em, not any more almighty at stopping our might than he is wise enough to bust all our sneaky plots and wiles. so, are we really gonna live like these vile scrubs—the entire heaven crew trampled and knocked out, forced to suffer chains and these brutal torments? it’s way better to stick with these than face something even more whack, in my honest advice; ‘cause fate itself is crushing us, and the omnipotent decree—the victor’s will—is locked down. to suffer or to act, our strength’s on the same level; and the law is cool with it. that was the original plan, if we were smart enough, to go up against so epic a foe, even though we’re lowkey sweating over what might go down.”

“lol, i crack up when those bold speartip gangsters, all audacious and venturous, if they glitch and get all cowardly, end up shrinking and freaking out over what they know is coming—to endure exile, ignominy, chains, or straight-up pain, the sentence handed down by their conqueror. this is our doom now; but if we somehow hold it together and bear it, our supreme foe might eventually chill his anger a lot, and maybe, once he’s far removed from our antics, won’t even care that we dissed him—satisfied with his own punishments, letting his raging fires slack off if his breath don’t stoke them. then our pure essence might just overcome their toxic vapors; or get so used to it we don’t even feel a thing; or, after a wild transformation, we adjust to the heat and vibe with it, so that the fierce burn becomes chill and the treacherous darkness turns light; plus, what hope might endless future days bring—what chance, what change worth waiting for—since our current lot is kinda happy, though a bit ill, and not the absolute worst, as long as we don’t self-sabotage with extra woe.”

thus belial, decked out in reason’s fly gear, dropped some wisdom spouting ignoble ease and mad peaceful sloth vibes—though not actual peace—and then mammon hopped in, saying:—

“either we go full send to disenthrone the king of heaven by warring, if war’s the best flex, or we hustle to regain our lost rights. to unthrone him, we might just pull that move when everlasting fate eventually caves to fickle chance and chaos plays judge in this epic strife. the first option’s hella vain, just as vain as the second, ‘cause what spot could ever be ours in heaven unless we straight-up overpower the top lord supreme? imagine if he chilled and dished out grace to everyone on some promise of new subjection—like, with what eyes could we even stand humble in his presence and take on strict new laws, forced to blurt out warped hymns and hallelujahs while he sits all lordly as our envied sovereign, with his altar droppin’ ambrosial odors and flowers and our servile offerings? that’s supposed to be our mission in heaven—our delight. but yo, eternity spent worshipping someone we lowkey despise is mad wearisome! so let’s not chase that impossible force, even if it’s granted by leave.”

unacceptable, yo even in heaven our vibe is lowkey basic npc energy mad vassalage flex but we gotta yeet that self-made glow up cuz we chasin’ our own drip from within livin’ solo in this cosmic deadzone free af and accountable to none – hard hustle is the only flex over that cringe, easy servile yoke, no cap our epic greatness gonna pop when we drop minor wins that be both clutch and savage, whether helpful or harsh, crafting chaos in any spot where evil lurks so we grind and flip pain into ease via nonstop labour and endurance, deadass

yo now are we even trippin’ on this deep dark? how often does the heavenly big boss, behind thick glitch clouds, choose his chill pad with drip still on lock, shrouding his throne in that dark majestic aura while deep bass thunders drop like glitchy memes? muster up that rage cuz heaven’s now lowkey vibing like hell, fr fr, and if he’s rockin’ that divine shadow, why can’t we yeet his lit glow on demand? this barren turf still holds mad hidden drip, gems, and gold and we got the skill to craft our own epic flex so what even is heaven gonna show that beats our hustle

our burn scars might just flip into core vibes over time these piercing fires be soft yet savage switching our mood until pain is just a deleted file, deadass all be chillin’ like they call for peaceful convos and orderly states to remix our present mess into a safe blueprint while we ghost all war thoughts – squad, take this advice, it’s the only hack

he barely dropped that banger when the whole assembly went off like hollow rocks catchin’ sick wind memes all night long stirring up the sea while seafaring homies, hoarse from the chaos, peeped their bark or tiny craft gettin’ dropped by chance in a craggy bay post-tempest; mad applause dropped as mammon wrapped his set with a peace vibe cuz they were shook by a field scarier than hell itself – thunder and michael’s sword still lurkin’ in their cores – and the hunger to build their own nether empire, a slowburn empire built by long game policy to mirror heaven’s drip

and then beelzebub peeped that – aside from satan, no one else was that lit – so with a grave look he rose like a straight-up pillar of state, his front engraved with deep deliberation and public care, his princely counsel still flexin’ on his ruined face, majestic like atlantean heavy lifters built to carry the weight of mega monarchies, drawing crowds like a midnight livestream while spittin’ out these epic words:

“thrones and imperial powers, offsprings of heaven, ethereal virtues! or must we ditch that title drop and rebrand as princes of hell? cuz the popular vote is all in – we’re here to keep it 100 and build our own fire empire while we dream big, unaware that the king of heaven already cursed this crib as our dungeon not as a safe getaway beyond his potent flex, trapping us in a new league that’s still tight af under his inevitable clamp, our captive squad locked in – for real, he’s still the sole king in any deep or high flex and won’t lose an inch of his kingdom to our revolt, but instead extends his iron rule over hell and rules us here like his golden homies in heaven”

so what we even doin’ with peace versus war? war already clapped us with irreparable loss and left no chill peace terms on deck – what peace is there for us enslaved except hardcore custody, mad stripes, and random arbitrary punishment? and what peace can we push back if not our own raw power, untamed hostility, and slow-brewed revenge always scheming how the conqueror might end up reaping his own rewards while barely flexin’ in our deep suffering vibe?

and yo, we ain’t gonna trip or need a wild expedition to invade heaven – whose high walls ain’t scared of any assault or deep ambush – so what if we scope out a chill hustle instead? word is there’s a spot (if ancient heavenly prophecies ain’t ghostin’ us) another world, the hype crib for a new race called man, droppin’ soon, made kinda like us but way less flexed in power and excellence though hella favoured by the top boss; his will was loud out among the gods and sealed by an oath that shook heaven’s whole circle, deadass

so let’s bend our brain and scope what critters run that new jam – what they’re made of, their savage or soft upgrades, where they get weak, and whether they flex by brute force or lowkey subtle plays; even if heaven’s locked up and its top arbitrator holds it down tight, this spot might be chill enough for some defense and maybe a sudden savage play could pop off – either launching hell-fire to roast his entire creation or snatching it as our own and yeeting out the puny habitants, or if we can’t drive ‘em out, seduce ‘em into our crew so that their god turns foe and then, with a repentant swipe, scrubs his own works; that move would be next-level revenge, interrupting his joy with our chaos and cranking our own hype when his darling sons, hurled headfirst to vibe with us, end up cursing their frail OG and faded bliss – faded so fast, no cap! so squad, advise – is this hustle worth a shot or should we just chill in the dark hatching vain empires?

thus beelzebub dropped his devilish counsel – originally cooked up by satan himself, the ultimate badboy – cuz who else could drop so deep a malice to glitch the whole human race at its root and mash earth with hell just to spite the great creator? but irony’s wild cuz their spite only boosts his cosmic glory, and this bold design lit up those infernal states, sparking pure joy in every eye as they all voted in full hype, so he went on with:

“well have ye judged, well ended long debate, synod of gods, and like to our epic selves resolved great moves which from the lowest deep will once again boost us up, defying fate, getting us nearer our ancient crib – maybe even scoping those bright confines where, with neighbouring homies and dope excursions, we might chance re-enter heaven; or else kick it in some mellow zone that still catches heaven’s fair light, secure and lit by an orient beam that scrubs away this gloom, with that soft, delish air healing the burn scars of these corrosive fires by breathing out its balm. but first, who we sendin’ to scout this new world? who’s gonna be enough? who’s ready to wander on foot through the dark, bottomless, infinite abyss and, through that palpable obscure, decode its raw, unfiltered way or spread his airy flight with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt edges before landing on the happy isle? what strength, what slick vibe can keep him safe through the thick angel checkpoints? here he’d need all the circumspection, and we got no less choice in our vote ‘cause on whoever we send rests the weight of all and our last hope.”

after droppin’ that epic set, he chilled out, his eyes all suspenseful, waiting on someone to step up, oppose, or take on this perilous, wild expedition; but the crew sat mute, deep in their own doom thoughts, each reading the other’s shock like a mirror – none among the top heaven-warriors had the guts to jump into that dreadful voyage solo; till finally, satan – now raised by transcendent glory above his fellows, rocking that monarchal pride and knowing his highest worth – dropped his own line:

“o progeny of heaven, o empyreal throne squad! reason got us in deep silence and lowkey demurrin’ though we ain’t scared. long and hard is the trek from hell to light. our prison’s a beast, this huge convex of fire that’s wild enough to eat us up ninefold, with blazing adamant gates shut tight over us so no one can bounce. and if any poor soul manages to pass, the void of unessential night swallows ‘em next, wide-gaping and leechin’ away all their vibe, plungin’ ‘em into that abortive gulf. and if by some glitch they escape into whatever world or unknown zone, what’s left that isn’t stacked with unknown dangers and brutal escapes? but i’d straight-up hate to lose this throne, o peers, or this imperial sovereignty decked out in mad splendour and armed with raw power, if any public moment of heat or danger could ever scare me off from hittin’ this grind. wherefore do i even rock these royalties instead of ghostin’ my reign, turnin’ down a huge share of hazard equal to the honour due to the top boss who sits way above the rest? so go, therefore, mighty powers, terror of heaven even if you’ve fallen; schemin’ at home while here we lock down our crib to ease our misery and make hell more tolerable – if there’s any cure, charm, or trick to ease, deceive, or slack the pain of this busted mansion; don’t ever drop your watch against a wakeful foe while i cruise all the coasts of dark destruction to snag deliverance for us all. this ride, no cap, none shall tag along with me.”

with that, the monarch bounced up, shutting down any clapback; wise af, cuz if any chief jumped in now they’d just get shut down and end up lookin’ like lame sidekicks stealing his high repute earned through epic hazard – but they weren’t more shook by his forbidding tone so they all rose with him at once, their collective uprising sounding like remote thunder, all bending toward his epic lead, deadass.

yo deadass droppin that mad respect vibes like we all stan this uber dank deity flexin on ‘em as if he were the ultimate god-tier gigachad out there in the cloud kingdom no cap he’s literally the top boss of the heavens yeet

and these peeps straight up went off spoutin praise like, “omg we’re livin for his vibe” even tho he lowkey ghosted his own squad for general safety cuz even them damned spirit npcs keep their drip intact so the basic haters can’t flex their sus clout moves on earth triggering extra glory and fake zeal—big yikes fr fr

so they ghosted their sketchy late-night confab drama and hit full stoked mode on their one and only chief like when from the mountain-top dankness the dusky clouds be risin while the north wind snoozes hard and the sky’s all cheerful until the mood flips and the stormy element throws shade on the dark low-key landscape but then the radiant sun drops a sweet farewell beam and the fields revive like a fresh update while the birds remix their tracks and the bleatin herds add to that epic vibe that rings across hills and valleys like a full-on glitch in 4k

oh damn, shame on men fr fr! even devilz squad up in tight bonds while us mere mortals be snippin at each other like total npc drama even when starin at heavenly grace and preachin godly peace they still be roastin in hate and beef throwin savage wars to wreck the planet and yeet each other into oblivion as if man ain’t already got a whole roster of hellish foes lurkin 24/7 waitin to demolish him deadass

so the stygian council got totally canceled and then rolled in the grand infernal peers in full order mode with their mega main dude comin in as the lone antagonist of heaven and hell’s dread emperor on supreme pomp flexin that fake god-tier state all circled by a globe of fiery seraphs rockin bright, over-the-top emblazonry and horrifically wild flame arms on god

then after that wild session they dropped the ultimate trumpets so loud it was like a regal sound bomb as four speedy cherubim with winged drip popped off banging alchemy sounds announced by a hype herald voice the hollow abyss picked it up on every channel and the whole host of hell came back with deafening shoutouts all caught in 4k clout overload

so then their glitchy brains chilled hard boosted by some sketchy hope and the squad powers got yeeted apart with each one wanderin his own laggy route followin whatever sad choice or inclination cuz they’re straight up perplexed trying to find a truce for those restless brain cells and kill the irksome hours till their great chief comes back to drop the ultimate save vibe

some rolled on the plain and others soared in sublime air race mode like they were in some olympian esports tournament flyin on wings or racin with rapid wheels or even crewin up in tight brigades like when war pops off to warn those prideful city npcs in a trippy sky battle with armies rushin in the clouds and airy knights pricking forth from the mist and plantin their spears till thick legions close like the whole welkin burns from epic feats at both ends of the heaven arena no chill

others, goin full typhoean rage mode, ripped up rocks and hills and rode the air in wild whirlwind flex so intense hell itself had trouble holdin the uproar like when ancient alcides got crowned from oechalia with conquest drip felt that envenomed robe and tore through pain right at the roots of thessalian pines while lichas got yeeted off oeta into the euboic sea totally savage meanwhile some kept it mild retreatin to a silent valley droppin angelic harp tracks about their own heroic livestream wins and epic fails in battle while moanin that fate got its wires crossed tryna force free virtue into chaos big yikes on god

their track was kinda half-baked but when the immortal spirit squad dropped that harmony it suspended hell itself and snatched the crowd with total ravishment while others sat solo on a chill hill in deep elevated feels discoursin about providence foreknowledge free will and fate like fixed destiny versus wild free will and ended up lost in an endless maze of brain glitches no cap

then they went off arguin good vs evil like an epic debate thread dissin happiness and final misery passion versus straight-up apathy and glory versus shame all wrapped up in vain wisdom and bogus philosophy but then some sneaky sorcery would charm pain for a hot sec or twist anguish into a fleeting hope or even armor up their hardened chests with stubborn patience like triple-layered steel shields legit savage endurance on god

another squad, rollin in gross bands on a bold adventure to scope out that dismal world searchin for any clime that might drop easier life hacks bent their flying march in four wild directions along the banks of four infernal rivers that yeeted their baleful streams—abhorred styx spillin deadly hate, sad acheron drippin sorrow black and deep, cocytus blastin loud lamentations on a rueful flow and fierce phlegeton droppin waves of torrent fire that inflame with raw rage no cap

way off from that mess, there’s a slow silent stream lethe the river of oblivion rollin out its watery labyrinth where any soul that takes a swig totally yeets its past self away forgettin both joy and grief pleasure and pain like complete memory wipe mode

beyond that flood lies a frozen continent dark and wild beat down by perpetual storms of wild whirlwind and dire hail that never thaws just hoards into ancient ruin like a busted pile of old memes with deep snow and ice a gulf as profound as that serbonian bog between damiata and mount casius where whole armies got sunk and the parching air burns frosty while cold acts like a fake fire straight up brainfreeze

yo then by harpy-footed furies hauled in at set intervals all the damned get dropped like clockwork feelin the bitter twist of extremes one minute roastin’ on blazing fire beds next starvin in ice with no ethereal warmth left stuck immovable in frozen time then madly yeeted back into the fire cycle on god

they be ferryin over this lethean sound back and forth boostin their sorrow levels and wishin and strugglin hard to hit that tempting stream for one tiny drop to drown all pain and woe in one sweet moment almost at the brink but fate be like, nah fam and stands strong with medusa rollin out gorgonian terror to guard the ford making the water ditch any taste of livin like it already yeeted itself off the lip of tantalus so these confused adventurer bands roamed in a forlorn, glitchy march with shudderin horror and eyes straight aghast checkin their lamentable lot and realizin there’s zero rest in this eternal lag

through mad dark and dreary vales they tripped and passed so many dolorous regions over frozen and fiery alps a mishmash of rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and straight-up death shades like a whole universe of death where god cursed it to spawn evil for evil’s sake and where all life yeets out and death’s the only one left reppin nature that breeds perverse monstrous and prodigious shit so obominable and inutterable it’s worse than any feeble fable or fear meme ever conceived with gorgons hydras and chimeras droppin dire remix vibes on deck

meanwhile the ultimate bad boi adversary of god and man satan lit up with next-level schemin slaps on his swift wings and yeets himself toward the gates of hell on a solo flight sometimes scoping the right coast sometimes the left then smooth glidin over the deep and soarin up to that fiery concave tower high af like a straight-up daredevil yeet

imagine as if far off at sea a fleet be hangin in the clouds ridin equinoctial winds close sailin from bengala or them ternate and tidore isles where merchants push spicy drugs cruisin on that trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape plying nightly toward the pole so appears that flyin fiend until at last hell-bounds show up high reachin the horrid roof with gates tripled threefold brass then iron then adamantine rock all impenetrable and skewered with circlin fire yet still unburnt and chill and right before the gates sat a formidable shape on both sides like ultimate sub-boss presets

one of these shapes looked like a woman up to the waist lookin kinda fair at first but then got all foul with mad scaly folds voluminous and vast like a serpent armed with a lethal sting and right around her middle a nonstop squad of hell-hounds barked with wide cerberean mouths droppin hideous peals yet if any noise even disturbed them they’d creep lowkey into her belly and kennel down all secret style still barkin and howlin underneath unseen while next up came vexed scylla chillin in the sea that splits calabria from the hoarse trinacrian shore and then even uglier the night-hag who rides through the air on secret summon vibes lured by that stank smell of infant blood to dance with lapland witches as the labouring moon straight-up eclipses their wicked charms and then the other shape if you can even call it that had zero distinguishable parts no members no joints nothing solid just a shadow standin black as night fierce as ten furies and terrible as hell shakin a dreadful dart vibe with a head that flexed like a kingly crown on the noggin

satan was right there now and off his throne the monster rolled forward with horrid strides so intense that hell itself trembled with every step the undaunted fiend was like yo this wild shit should be admired not feared (except for god and his son cuz they’re the OG created who never got dissed) and with a dismissal that dripped disdain he clapped back sayin “yo whence and what art thou execrable shape that even though you’re grim and totally terrifying you dare roll your miscreated front right in my way to those yonder gates im about to cruise through without even askin permission so scram or get roasted by your own folly and learn the real deal hell-born that you ain’t here to tussle with the heavenly spirit squad”

and then the goblin, full of raw wrath, snapped back “yo are you that traitor angel are you the one who first broke the peace vibe in heaven and smashed faith—til then unbroken—draggin behind you a third of heaven’s sons all rebellious and summoned against the highest boss which got you and your crew outcast from god condemned to waste eternal days in woe and pain and you still think you can roll with the spirits of heaven even though you’re hell-doomed blowing defiance and scorn where i reign as the ultimate king your self-proclaimed lord so now back to your punishment, no cap”

yo fam false fugitive, and like, slap on some epic wings on that speed, deadass  
lest i go full scorpion-whip mode chasing your lag, or with one savage dart yeet some weird horror at you, droppin pain vibes you’ve never even caught in 4k before, no cap

so spake the ultra-spooky terror, flexin his menace in full drip, hype tenfold and extra deformed, while on the flip side  
satan stood, totally untouchable and lit like a comet blasting thru ophiuchus, fire streaks in the arctic sky, his horrid hair spinnin pestilence and war like a glitchy skibidi beat

each badman leveled his lethal aim, no second shot—pure one-hit mode—and threw savage frowns at each other like two dank black clouds loaded with heaven’s artillery rattling over the caspian, then hoverin front to front, waitin on that wind signal to yeet their dark encounter mid-air, deadass

so the mighty combatants frownd hard, makin hell even darker with their epic glare, standin matched like rare npcs meetin a mega foe; and all the dope deeds that had had hell shook  
woulda stayed lit if not for that sneaky snakey sorceress posted by the hell-gate clutchin the fatal key, then risin up with a hideous outcry to crash between, full meltdown

“hey daddy, what’s your move rn?” she screamed, “why you tryna yeet that mortal dart at your own pops? and yo, who u even doin this for? for the dude above laughin at your weak sauce, droppin his orders like justice drips—his wrath gonna yeet both of y’all one day, deadass!”

she dropped that wild line and even the hellish pest chilled for a sec; then satan clapped back:—

“yo your outcry is mad sus and your words are glitchin so hard that my impulsive hand got paused, so imma show you through savage deeds what’s poppin, but first i gotta peep what you even are, double-formed extra, and why in this infernal trap you be callin me daddy and that spooky phantom calls my son. i don’t know you, nor have i ever peeped a sight more detestable than you two, pure yeet vibe

and then the hell-gate portress clapped back like—  
“yo, you forgot me already? you think i look so foul now? i was once mad fresh in heaven, straight flexin at the assembly with all the seraphim conspirin against heaven’s king, until sudden misery dimmed your eyes and got you spun in darkness while your head was droppin thick flames, until on the left side a burst opened and—bam! out popped a goddess armed, shining and bright like your ideal image. the whole squad of heaven got shook, bouncin back in fear and callin me sin as a portent, but as we got cozy, i charmed even the haters—you most of all, cuz you peeped yourself in me, fallin mad in love in secret so hard that my womb got hit with a growing bomb burden. meanwhile war exploded in heaven, fields turnin chaotic—our almighty foe snatched clear victory while we got wrecked in the empyrean, yo. they were yeeted headlong from heaven’s pitch into this deep abyss, and i caught that freefall too; then this mega key got dropped into my grip, charged to lock these gates forever, no one allowed in without my yeet. i sat pensive and solo for a bit, but not long—till my womb, pregnant by you and now extra loaded, hit that prodigious motion with rueful, chaotic throes.

at last my odious offspring—your own begotten, bustin violent through my guts—tore up my whole core, warpin my nether form with pain and pure horror; then he, my inbred enemy, stormed out flexin his fatal dart on a mission to destroy. i dipped and screamed “death!” as hell trembled at that ugly name, all caves echoin’ a deep death sigh that bounced back, fr fr. i dipped, but he chased (more lit with lust than pure rage, honestly), and faster than all, caught me—his own mother, totally dismayed—and in nasty, forced embraces, spawned from that rapey act these yellin’ monsters, circlin me nonstop, spawned every hour with infinite sorrow, always creepin back into the womb that made ‘em, howlin and gnawin on my insides for munchies; then burstin afresh with conscious terror vibes surroundin me, no rest and no chill intermission, pure chaos

right before my eyes sat grim death, my own son and nemesis, the one who set this whole mess off, and me, his parent, almost gettin gobbled up ‘cause no other prey was around—yet he knows his doom is tied with mine, and that i’m a bitter morsel and his ultimate baneful snack whenever that moment drops, so fate dropped that verdict, deadass

but yo, daddy, imma forewarn you—dodge his deadly arrow; and don’t be trippin hopin you’re invincible in those bright heavenly arms, ‘cause that mortal stamp only works for the big boss above, no cap, none of us can flex that untouchable vibe

she wrapped it up; and the sly fiend caught on quick, chillin his heat, then smoothly fired back:

“dear daughter—you call me your sire and flaunt my fly son as the epic pledge of our secret dalliance in heaven, those joys once sweet now turned sad by wild, unforeseen chaos—just know, i ain’t comin as your enemy but to set you both free from this dark, dismal house of pain, you and him and the whole heavenly host of spirits that rolled with us when we bounced from on high. i’m on this rough errand solo, one mission for all, steppin lone into that unfounded deep and through the immense void on a wandering quest for a foretold spot—a place already created by concurring signs, vast and round—a blissful crib in the purlieus of heaven; and there they placed a bunch of scrappy upstart creatures to fill our empty room, though more remote, so that heaven, overloaded with potent multitudes, might not spark new beef, ya feel? whether it’s this or something even more secret, i’m in mad haste to know, and once i peep it, i’ll bounce back and bring you to that chill zone where you and death can hang easy, floatin unseen through the buxom air reppin sweet odours. there, you’ll get fed and filled for real—immeasurable, all things your prey, deadass.”

he paused, ‘cause both were hella pleased, and death cracked up a ghastly, grimy grin, hyped that his hunger was about to be fed, blessin his gape for that proper hour. his mother got just as lit, and then dropped on her sire:

“yo, i keep the key to this infernal pit by order of heaven’s all-powerful king, straight up forbidden to unlock these adamantine gates; and death always stands ready to interpose his dart, fearless to be outmatched by living hustle. but like, what do i owe to his orders from above, the dude who hates me and chucked me down into this deep tartarus gloom to serve in this hateful role, as a born inhabitant of heaven, stuck here in eternal agony with terrors and nonstop clamor from my own brood gnawin on my insides? you’re my father, my creator, the one who gave me life—so who should i obey but you? who do i follow? you’ll get me soon to that new light world of bliss where the gods chill, where i reign at your right hand, drippin with voluptuous vibes as befits your daughter and your baby, forever and ever, no cap.”

with that, from her side she snatched the fatal key—the sad instrument of all our woes—and rolled out her beastly crew; then, straight up, she yeeted the huge portcullis high, which even the full stygian powers couldn’t move on the regular, and twisted the intricate wards in the keyhole, unfastenin every bolt and bar of massive iron or rock like it was a chill flex. suddenly, with a wild recoil and jarring clank, the infernal doors flew open, and on their hinges grated harsh thunder that shook even the lowest depths of erebus, yo. she opened ‘em, but when it came to closin, her power was next level—so wide the gates stayed, and behind ‘em a bannered host with extended wings and spread ensigns marched up, letting in horses and chariots in a loose, lit array; they stood so wide, like a furnace mouth blasting out red smoke and ruddy flames, straight-up epic

before their eyes, right outta nowhere, popped the secrets of the hoary deep—a dark, illimitable ocean with no bounds, no dimensions, where length, breadth, height, time, and place just vanish; where the ancient night and chaos, the original ancients of nature, hold eternal anarchy amidst the endless clamor of wars and total confusion, mad wildin’ for real

yo, the four fierce champs—hot, cold, moist, and dry—are battlin here for mastery, droppin their embryonic atoms in a clout war; they rally around each faction’s flag in their own clans, whether light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow, swarming like uncountable grains on barca or cyrene’s torrid soil, drafted up to ride with the warring winds and flex their fragile wings. whoever they vibe with, chaos rules the moment like an umpire, droppin decisions that escalate the fray, and then chance, the high arbiter, governs it all. into this wild abyss—the womb of nature, maybe even her grave—there’s no sea, no shore, no air, no fire, but all these mixed up in a pregnant, confused soup that’s destined to fight forever unless the almighty maker orders his dark materials to spawn more worlds, straight up

into this wild abyss the wary fiend stood on the brink of hell, starin for a hot minute and ponderin his next voyage, ‘cause he had no narrow gap to slide through, and his ears were bombarded with loud, ruinous noises (comparing epic clout to small time) like when bellona storms in full fury, yeet.

with all her battering engines, straight up flexin’ in yeet-mode to raze  
some capital city, or lowkey if this frame of heaven were straight freefallin’, and these elements gone full npc mutiny, tearing off her axle like glitch-mode, spilling the steadfast earth—deadass! at last his sail-broad vans get slammed open for flight, and in that surgin’ smoke he yeets upward, ghostin’ the ground; then, like, many a league away, chillin’ in a cloudy sim chair, ascending on audacious vibes—but fr fr, that seat soon cancels out, and he meets a vast void, no cap. all unawares, flutterin’ his pennons for clout, then drops ten thousand fathoms deep, falling hard until this moment, if not for a mad accidental strong rebuff from some tumultuous cloud, lit with fire and nitre, that boosted him many miles aloft like a pure gigachad warp drive. that fury bailed—quenched in a boggy syrtis, not sea nor any good dry land, nearly sunk but still cruisin’, treading that raw, crude blueprint half on foot, half straight up fly-mode; now he’s gotta rock both oar and sail, deadass.

as when a gryphon goes full beast mode through the wilderness, flexin’ its winged course over hill or moory dale, chasin’ that arimaspian who, lowkey sussy, swiped the guarded gold from his watchful custody—so eager is the fiend, wreckin’ over bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare AF, using head, hands, wings, or feet to vibe his way, swimmin’, sinkin’, waddlin’, creepin’, or straight up flyin’. at length, a universal hubbub wild like chaotic discord noise, full of bumpin’ sounds and voices all mixed-up and confused, boomin’ through the hollow dark to assault his ear with loudest vehemence, pure skibidi blasts. thither he plies, undaunted, ready to meet whoever power or spirit lurkin’ in the nethermost abyss that’s ridin’ that noise—like, “yo, which way’s the nearest coast of darkness that borders on some legit light?” and then, boom, behold the throne of chaos with his dark pavilion sprawled wide on that wasteful deep! chillin’ on the throne with him, night—draped in sable vestments, the oldest ride-or-die queen of his reign—sits, with orcus and ades, plus the dreaded name of demogorgon; next up, rumour, chance, tumult, confusion, and discord, all mashed together like a thousand cringe meme threads.

  t’ whom satan, turnin’ bold af, drops: “ye powers and spirits of this nethermost abyss, chaos and ancient night, i ain’t here on spy vibes to snoop or stir up your secret drip; i’m just wanderin’ this dark as heck desert, ‘cause my path rolls through your massive empire up to that lit light, alone, guide-free, half lost—i’m on the search for the smoothest route that leads where your gloomy bounds lock up with heaven; or, if there’s some other zone from your dominion that the ethereal king just snatched, let me slide there—i’m travelin’ deep, so direct my course: no cap, if it brings mad rewards to your squad, i’ll bring that lost region back, kick out all that fake usurpation, and drop it back to its OG darkness under your sway (that’s my current grind), and then once more raise the standard of ancient night. yours gets all the clout, mine’s the revenge, deadass!”

  thus satan, and the anarch old, all shook and stutterin’ like a broke mic, answers: “yo, i know you, stranger—who the heck you are, that big-league leading angel who recently went head-on against heaven’s king, even though you got overthrown. i saw and heard it all; cause that massive host didn’t dip in silence through the terrified deep, ruin on ruin, rout on rout, confusion so extra it was chaotic AF; and heaven’s gates poured out, millions deep, with victorious bands chasin’—i’m posted up on my own turf here, defendin’ what little clout is left, even as our inside broils keep encroachin’ and weakly mess with old night’s crown: first, hell—your dungeon stretching mad wide underground; now, heaven and earth, another world just hangin’ over my realm, linked in a golden chain to that heavenside where your legions got wrecked! if that’s your stroll, you ain’t far off—the danger’s mad close. go, speed it up; havoc, spoilage, ruin—that’s my bag.”

  he dipped, and satan didn’t even stall to clap back, but, hyped that his sea finally found a shore, with fresh turbo alacrity and recharged force, springs upward like a fire-pyramid, blastin’ into the wild expanse and through the clashing shock of elements, all around like a glitchy rave, wins his way, harder boxed in and more endangered than when argo cut through the bosporus between tryna-be rocks, or when ulysses, dodging on his larboard from charybdis and steered by the other whirlpool, flexed hard. so he, with mad difficulty and epic grind, pushed on, laborin’ hard AF; but once he passed—yo, soon after, when man just tumbled down—wild curveball! sin and death went full send, followin’ his trail (heaven’s will, no cap) and paved a broad, beat route over that dark abyss, whose boiling depths just took it, like a legendary bridge stretching from hell all the way to the utmost orb of this flimsy world; by that, the perverse spirits, chillin’ and bouncin’ for easy hangouts, slide to and fro to tempt or punish mortals—except those guarded by god and his squad of chill angels on special grace vibes.

but now, at last, sacred light vibes appear and, from the walls of heaven, shoot far into the dim night’s chest a glimmering dawn drip. here, nature first starts out at her farthest edge while chaos takes a chill pill, like a foe broken off from her outer works—less tumult, less hostile clamor; so that satan, with way less grind now and max ease, drifts on the calmer wave in that dubious, sus light, and—like a weather-beaten, busted vessel—comfortably docks at the port, even though shrouds and riggings are ripped; or, in the emptier void, almost vapor-like, he spreads his wings, chillin’ at leisure to peep far out the empyreal heaven, laid out in a circuit, undetermined like square or round, with opal towers and battlements decked in live sapphire—yea, his native crib once—while, fast by, hangin’ in a golden chain, this pendent world looms, as massive as a star of tiniest scale chillin’ near the moon. thither, loaded with savage, mischievous revenge and cursed AF in a cursed hour, he bounces off.

book iii

hail, holy light, offspring of heaven firstborn, or of that eternal, co-eternal beam, may i drop your vibes unblam’d? since god is light, and he’s always been chillin’ in that pristine, unapproached glow from eternity—just pure bright effluence of that increate, luminous essence. or maybe you’re more like a pure ethereal stream, whose fountain? who even knows—pre-sun, pre-heavens, you were on it, and at god’s voice, like drapping a fresh mantle, you decked out the risin’ world of dark, deep waters, snatched straight from the void and infinite formless abyss. i’m here re-visitin’ you with bolder wings, fam—escaped that stygian pool even though i was long detained in that murky timeout, while on my flight through utter and mid darkness i dropped notes not even orphean, spittin’ verses about chaos and eternal night; taught by the heavenly muse to dip down the dark descent and then climb back up, though mad hard and hella rare: you, i revisited safe, and i can feel your sovereign, vital lamp—but yo, you ain’t revisitin’ these eyes, rollin’ in vain searchin’ for that piercing ray, findin’ no dawn; so thick a serene drop clamped their orbs or got 'em veiled in dim suffusion. yet i ain’t stoppin’ my wander though, roamin’ where the muses chill—clear springs, shady groves, sunny hills, all drenched in that sacred song love; but top of the list, you, sion, and the flowery brooks below that rinse your hallowed feet, warblin’ their flows, which i vibe with nightly—nor do i forget those other two, my fate homies, who were equal in renown, entrusted by your sovereign command that man must snag some grace—blind thamyris, blind maeonides, and tiresias and phineus, those old prophet OGs. then, munch on those thoughts that voluntary drop harmonious beats, like a wakeful bird droppin’ dark tunes while hid in the shadiest nook, layin’ down her nocturnal note. thus, as the year spins and the seasons loop back, none of that day or the sweet vibe of even or morn returns to me—not the sight of spring bloom, summer’s rose drip, flocks, herds, or that divine human face; instead, it’s clouds all day, darkness non-stop surroundin’ me, cut off from the chill ways of real peeps, and for the book of knowledge, i get served a universal blank page—nature’s works all wiped and ras’d, and wisdom locked out at the door.

so much the rather, you celestial light, shine inward and let the mind’s full power irradiate—plant those eyes, purge all that mist to peep and spill on things invisible to mortal sight.

now, the almighty father from up above, chillin’ in that pure empyrean where he reigns high, bent his eye down on his own squad and their works all at once: around him, all the sanctities of heaven were decked out like a star-studded squad, receivin’ beatitude beyond words; on his right sat the radiant image of his glory—his only son; on earth he first peeped our two og parents, the only pair of humankind in that happy garden zone, reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, uninterrupted joy, unrivalled heart vibes, in blissful solitude; then he scoped hell and the gulf between, and there he spotted satan, coastin’ the wall of heaven on this side of night, in that dun, sublime air, all set to stoop with tired wings and willing feet onto the bare outskirts of this world, which looked like firm land, stripped of any firmament—uncertain if it’s ocean or air, idk. god, posted high from his loft, where past, present, future all mix up, then turned to his only son and dropped the tea: only begotten son, peep that rage fueling our adversary—whose fury ain’t held back by any bounds, no bars in hell, no chains piled on him, and not even the wide main abyss, with all its interrupts, can hold him down; he’s deadset on savage, desperate revenge that’ll boomerang on his own rebellious head. and now, breakin’ all the rules, he’s wingsing his way—not far off from heaven—in the zones of light, headin’ straight toward that brand new world, and man placed there, on a mission to test if he can destroy him by brute force or, worse, twist his vibe with some bogus guile; and he’s gonna pervert, ‘cause man’s gonna fall for his glozing, cheesy lies.

and deadass yeeted the one legit command, no cap flexin' like a glitch in the matrix, ray of epic diss  
that lone oath of obedience, fr fr so he got yeeted into the fall vibes, straight-up clapped by his own glitch factor lol

created flexibly, so they can't justly call me out on the epic sauce, nah fam  
their maker, or how they were modded, or even destiny got yeeted—all hella questionable  
like, as if destiny was a total dictator, no cap predestined af, glitching fate vibes  
their will got bossed by an absolute decree, like a glitch in the grid that yeets your inspo  
or high-key, foreknowledge hype they self-approved, like self-owning troll mode, absurdly extra  
their own savage brain-fuck rebellion, not me; if i saw it coming, that ain't a flex, bruh

until they self-trap with their own cringe drama; or else, i gotta flip their script, no cap  
their vibe gets remodded and that epic, unchangeable decree gets yeeted like a nuked server rule  
unchangeable eternal af—the decree that got snatched and had no cap permanence  
their freedom itself, but yo they lowkey signed up for their own crash, self-sabotage vibes, fr fr

silence dropped in heaven; for man’s sake no patron or intercessor showed, like a crashed server, so sus  
and even less someone daring to scribble that deadly forfeiture on their own feed—straight banned vibes  
the lethal forfeiture bomb and ransom setup was just a hot mess meme deal, deadass

now, without any redemption PR, the entire mankind is toast, judged as lost vip  
tagged with death and hell subtitles, no blockbuster save—pure doom, severe as hell  
if it weren't for that son of god, the ultimate lifesaver with full bomb divine love drip,  
he renewed his dearest mediation like epic patch notes, total guardian of bae vibes

life inside me forever locked, thanks to you, i live unbreakably  
even though now i'm handing it to death like paying dues, calculated no cap  
every bit that can crash, once that debt's paid, it's all swiped with no regrets  
you won't dip and leave me in that nasty grave, no way, my soul stays pure—mid ain't allowed  
neither prey on me nor let my unspotted soul chill in permanent corruption, deadass  
but yo, i will rise victorious af, subduing every vanquisher, yeeted flat  
my opp gets clapped, his vaunted spoils straight-up spoiled, ratio bust  
death itself—its own wound gonna get hit back, then stoop, extra lowkey  
inglorious vibes, his mortal sting completely disarmed, bonk, no venom, cancel culture hit  
i'll soar through that ample air in high triumph, like jet mode, yeet up  
leading hell captive despite its own drama, showing off bound dark powers, legend status  
the dark side's powers get totally bound-up, and you, at that epic sight,  
are megachill, looking down from heaven with a skibidi smile, fr fr  
while, thanks to you, i'm raised high and demolishing all my foes in epic yeet roast  
death comes last, stuffing the grave with its own carcase like a dumpster fire glitch  
then, with my whole redeemed squad, we slide back into heaven, long absent, then boomerang back in full clout  
yo father, to vibe with your face where no cloud of rage hangs—only pure zen peace, deadass  
no anger, just eternal calm like a cosmic spa; wrath is fizzled, totally cancelled  
from then on only full-on joy in your presence—vibes for days

his words ended here, but his chill, meek face still dropped silent, pure af  
silent yet still spittin' vibes and breathin' that immortal love, unfiltered drip  
to us mortal peeps, only familial obedience shone above, real and raw  
filial obedience like a sacrifice served up as a tribute to the ultimate will  
all glad to be dropped, he vibed with that will, streaming his heart in pure dedication  
of his epic daddy—and heaven went into full admiration, a storm of awe, epic fire  
all of heaven wonderin' what this chaotic meltdown meant and where it was trending, fam  
but then soon the almighty dropped his savage reply:

yo, o you in heaven and earth—the only legit peace found for mankind under mad wrath,  
my one and only chill fix! you know how mad dear all my works are, fr  
to me every drop of my work is pure gold; not even man, even as the last creation,  
gets your vibe spared from my bosom and right-hand realness, 'cause losing you even for a minute  
would yeet the whole race into total loss, smh

so you, the only one who can redeem, join your nature with theirs in a fusion remix,  
and become yourself man among men on earth—an avatar made flesh when time drops,  
born fresh from virgin seed vibes, a wondrous birth glitch  
be in adam’s crib as the top boss of all mankind, even if just adam’s son, flexin' hard  
as all men flop in him, so in you they bounce back—a second root revival, multithreaded  
restoration mode on: as many get relaunched, without you none got the drip

his epic crime flags all his sons as guilty, but your merit acts like a saving firewall, adored  
imputed straight up to absolve those who cut loose their own scammy deeds, righteous or unrighteous  
and if they vibe living in you, transplanted like a remix skin and catchin' that fresh new life juice  
then man, justly, gotta get his due—satisfy, be judged, crash, and then rise in the final round,  
with his bros ransomed with his own dear life, trade value 100, no cap

so that heavenly love totally trumps hellish hate, flexin' all over death  
giving death a makeover and dying to redeem like paying full dm cost, radical twist, deadas  
so madly trying to redeem what hellish hate disses, dropping hate tokens like a busted server update,  
so easily crushed yet still wreckin’ chaos in those who when given be like “nah, grace ain't my vibe,”  
total self-sabotage, extra cringe

and yo, by droppin' down to take on man’s nature, don't lower your own epic level—keep that prime clout, no cap  
because even though you chill on the highest bliss throne, sittin' on cloud 9 in full beta mode,  
you’re equal to god-level flex, munchin' on that godlike fruit, mega infinite drip

when u roll up, all glammed out from the heavens like a skibidi light show, flexin’ on every level, omg  
u gonna pop off in the sky, then yeet out arch-angel summons like fiery emojis, full-on siren mode, fr  
summon those arch-angel ballers to blast out the tribunal decree, no cap, pure cosmic clout  
u set up that dread tribunal, and all winds be like “yo, drop that savage remix instantly!” all over, deadass  
the entire living squad – and even the cited dead, resurrected af – get yeeted into this epic doom run, on god  
from all the ancient meme eras, sliding hard toward that general doom drop, like an ultimate glitch meltdown  
goin’ off in a mad rush; that thunderous clap gonna wake ‘em like an unexpected notification, legit yeet  

then, when all ur saint homies be assembled, u step up to judge like a true gigachad, no cap  
bad dudes and rogue angels, arraigned and ready for the roast, gonna sink under your smackdown verdict, big yikes  
they all drop beneath your sentence; hell, packed with extra evil npcs, gets clamped shut forever like a banned discord channel  
meanwhile the world gets lit—burning up and dropping remix vibes where new heaven and earth pop up, total glow-up  
a fresh drop of heaven and earth emerges where the real ones dwell, straight legendary, on god  
after a marathon of tribulations and endless chaos, golden days shine loaded with dank deeds and flexed goals, 100%  
where joy and peace snatch trophies like viral trends and truth slaps with the tightest drip, deadass  

then u yeet aside that regal scepter, ‘cause royal drip ain’t needed no more, yo  
no cap, that scepter’s obsolete—u don’t need that old school crown when god becomes the whole vibe, all in all  
but listen up, all ye faux gods: worship that dude who died to wrap up this entire cosmic meltdown, fr  
show mad love and honor the son just like u honor me, full heart, straight savage  

yo, as soon as the almighty peaced out, the entire angel multiverse erupted with a massive shout, like infinite emoji spam, sweet af  
the massive angel squad hollered as if endless voices dropped joy bombs, turning heaven into a viral rave beat drop, on god  
with a mega jubilee and hosannas flooding the eternal zones, even the lowkey ones showing respect like true legends  
toward every throne they yeet their adoration, bowing so low they drop their crowns—inlaid with mad amarant and gold drip, all extra and lit  
that immortal amarant, once a flower chillin’ by the tree of life in paradise, started to bloom until man’s cringe offense got it yeeted from heaven, and now it just grows there ironically  
up high, blooms shade that fount of life like a skyscraper of petals; meanwhile the river of bliss flows through heaven, streaming an amber drip over elysian flowers, pure viral vibes  
with those eternal blooms, the chosen spirit squad twists their radiant locks into beam-wrapped swag—hair goals on a next-level, all loose garlands thrown over a pavement that shines like a sea of jasper, lit with celestial rose filters and wild impurpled smiles  

then, re-crowned af, they snatch their golden harps like epic loot—harps tuned on fleek, glittering like extra accessories hung by quivers, dropping a preamble sweeter than any tiktok intro  
they unleash that sacred jam that wakes up all the raptures high, every single voice vibing in perfect melodic spam so lit that heaven itself feels that unifying concord, no cap  

u, father, were first on the track, singing “omnipotent” with all that immutable, immortal, infinite drip, the eternal king and original architect of all being  
u, the fountain of light, lowkey invisible within the glorious brightness where u chill on that unreachable throne, but when u flex and shade your beams so extra that even your skirts glitch between brilliance and dark overload, those brightest seraphs can’t even come close—covering their eyes with both wings in total yeet mode  

next up, they dropped a track about the whole creation kickoff, u the begotten son, the divine mirror, with a face so clear it makes the almighty father’s glow pop off like a never-ending livestream  
no other creature can peep such epic clarity; u got the effulgence of his glory stamped on u, his ample spirit transfused into u like the ultimate cosmic drip, on god  

the heaven of heavens and all the power squads inside got crafted by u, and by your savage vibe, u yeeted aspiring dominations out of existence  
those wannabe dominations got clapped that day—your daddy’s dreadful thunder went off, shaking heaven like a full-on firestorm while you yeeted warring angels into total disarray, epic meltdown vibes, deadass  

coming back from the chase, your powers got roasted with a loud hype, and u were the only one extolled, son of that boss-level might, to drop fierce vengeance on his foes like a savage yeet bomb  
but on man? nah, though man got wrecked by malice, you held back the doomer vibe—leaning into pity mode as the ultimate heart drip  
barely your dear and only son peeped that u weren’t about to strictly doom frail man, so he stepped in to chill your wrath and squash the strife, offering his life as the ultimate sacrifice for man’s offense—o, unexampled love, love so divine it’s the purest drip, on god  
hail, son of god, savior of men! your name becomes the epic content of my eternal jam, with my heart never ghosting your praise or dropping your father’s clout, ever  

up in heaven, above that starry canvas, the squad chilled in endless joy and hymns, nonstop vibes, while down on this round globe—this wild, opacous planet—the first convex splits the luminous lower orbs, all locked in like a secret meme room shielded from ancient chaos and dark trolls  
satan dropped in, strollin’ on a far-off globe that now seems like a vast, boundless continent, dark, wasted, and wild under night’s grim frown with starless skies and perpetual storm rants, total chaos mode, big yikes  
except on that off-chill side of the heavenly wall, where a soft gleam catches in glimmering air less riled by loud tempests, here the fiend roamed free in a spacious field, solo like a rogue NPC, on god  

like a vultur on imaus bred, with a snowy ridge where roving tartar npcs bounded, dislodging from prey-scarce zones like a barren meme desert to gorge on the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids, on hills where flocks grub, flies zooming to the springs of the ganges or hydaspes—indian streams all fluid and viral—then he lights upon barren plains of sericana, where chinesers roll with their light cany waggons, sails billowing as they cruise on wind, total oriental drip, no cap  

so on this windy land-sea, the fiend wandered up and down, riding solo, bent on his next prey like a mad savage in ghost mode—‘cause in that empty zone not a single living or lifeless soul lurked, until later, when a store of ephemeral vibes floated up like aerial vapor in a vaporwave aesthetic, all of it transitory and vain as sin filled up men’s cringy works, built on empty clout and hollow hopes of glory or eternal fame, leaving only bitter superstition and blind zeal for men’s praise, so that their payback turned out empty as their floppy deeds, dissolving on earth like unfinished mods, before finally roaming as ghost memes in a vast void—not even lounging on a neighboring moon as some dreamed, but in argent fields more like mid-tier spirit homesteads betwixt angelic drip and human clout, no cap  

then came the ill-joined sons and daughters from ancient days, those colossal giants with mad vain exploits—even though they were famous, it was all extra drama; next up, the babel builders on the plain of sennaar, tryna flex with vain design, and if they had the clout they’d build new babels, epic towers of hype, on god  
others showed up solo—like that one dude hailed as a god who leaped headfirst into aetna’s flames, full-on heat, and empedocles, plus the guy who dived into plato’s elysium by yeeting himself into the sea, and many more long names of embryos, idiots, eremites, and friars—white, black, and gray—all flashing their extra trumpery, total chaotic remix  

and here the pilgrims roam, straying far to seek that long-dead legend from golgotha who still lives in heaven, while the ones sure about paradise, dying, rock the dominick weeds or a full-on franciscan disguise, passin’ by the seven planets and that fixed crystal sphere balancing all the trepidation like a final boss scale, then st. peter waits at heaven’s gate with his keys, standing at the base as the ascent begins, when lo—a violent crosswind from either coast blasts them sideways ten thousand leagues off, yeeting them into devious air, where u might peep cowls, hoods, and habits, all tossed into ragged chaos, with relics, beads, indulgences, dispenses, pardons, and even bulls spun aloft by the wind’s sport, flying over the backside of the far-off world into a vast limbo famously called the paradise of fools, known only by a few obscure souls, now unpeopled and untrod, total ghost zone, no cap  

all this dark globe the fiend scoped out on his wander, drifting until a gleam of dawning light hit his path in a mad rush, and from afar he peeped an epic level-up—ascending in magnificent degrees up to the wall of heaven, where a kingly palace-gate structure glowed like the ultimate flex, decked out with diamond and gold frontispiece, thick with sparkling orient gems, unmatched on earth, beyond any mortal pencil sketch, pure legendary drip, on god  

these stairs—exactly the ones where jacob peeped angels ascending and descending in lit bands as he fled from esau to padan-aram in the field of luz—had him dreaming under the open sky, then waking and shouting “this is the gate of heaven,” revelation real, no cap  
each stair had its own mysterious plan, not always there but sometimes drawn upward like a spooky glitch, and underneath flowed a bright sea of jasper or liquid pearl on which those coming from earth, failing to land, were wafted by angels or even flew over the lake, rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds, ultimate flex mode activated, deadass  

the stairs were then let down—either giving the fiend an easy ascent or aggravating his sad exclusion from the blissful doors—right against which a secret passage opened from below, just over the blissy seat of paradise, a passage down to earth so wide it felt like an interdimensional freeway, wider than any after-time pathway over mount sion or the promised land so dear to god, letting his angels shuttle to and fro to vibe with those happy tribes from paneas at jordan’s flood to beersaba where the holy land borders egypt and the arabian shore, mad cross-cultural drip, on god; the opening was so wide, with no bounds like the endless ocean wave tying into darkness, raw and infinite, no cap  

satan, from that point, now on the lower stair—who scaled those gold steps to the heaven gate with cosmic drip—looks down with pure wonder at the sudden view of the whole world at once, like a scout trekking dark desert ways with danger left in the dust, on god  



all night fr, deadass vibin all night and then boom at that break of hella cheery dawn, no cap  
snags the brow of some mad high climpin’ hill like a total gigachad defyin gravity omg skibidi  
yo his peepers catch that vista unaware like scrolling insta feeds and miss that clout drop, deadass  
the dope view of some extra af foreign zone where npcs chill and vibes hit different, on god  
first peepin’ or a mega renowned metropolis flexin’ with all that drip, legit yeet  
with spires glisterin like neon flex and pinnacles mad decked out in pure bling, no cap  
and now the risin sun drips golden beams like a dank filter, straight up mood shift  
so he scoops that wonder even after he peeped heaven’s high-key drip, i’m shook fr  
the trash spirit, malidin and lowkey jelly, big yikes have him catchin envy real quick at that all-fair world flex  
round he scopes the whole sitch (and like, where he stood so high above that circlin’ blackout canopy of night’s extended shade, deadass)  
from that eastern beat of libra to the fluffy star droppin andromeda vibes off atlantick seas like some cosmic yeet  
beyond the horizon, then from pole to pole he be scopin in mad breadth, no pause, yeetin his flight straight into the world’s original zone with pure precipitate swag and breezy winds  
through that pristine marble air his slanted glide cuts among endless stars that be shinin, glitchin in the distance yet lowkey lookin like other wild realms, on god  
or those realms look like happy isles, sorta like the hesperian gardens from old school legends, lucky fields, groves, flowery vales, triple happy isles, lol  
but who was vibin there? he straight up dipped on askin, no cap  
over it all the golden sun, flexin like heaven’s own, seduced his peepers so his route bent straight toward that epic drip, on god fr fr  
through that chill firmament (but up or down, by center or eccentrick, who even knows, skrrt)  
where the big luminary stays aloof from the basic constellations that keep their distance like true bosses, dispensin far-off light  
and as they twist in their starry dance crunchin days, months, years computed like wild algorithms toward his all-cheering lamp, they spin or get flipped by his magnet beam that soft warms the universe, sliding into every secret nook unseen, yet dropping invisible virtue deep like hidden bonus levels, deadass  
so lit was his station, pure cosmic drip set on bright  
and then boom lands the fiend, a spot so extra that even an astronomer peepin through his sun’s shiny orb never caught that insane flex, caught in 4k for real  
the joint he found was beyond expression bright, compared to anything on earth, metal or stone, all sus yet equally lit  
where not every piece is the same but all glow like hot iron set on fire, if metal then part gold and part clear silver, on god  
if stone, think pure carbuncle or chrysolite, ruby or topaz flexin like the dozen jewels on aaron’s chest plate plus one extra pop, imagined mad often more than anywhere else, like that legendary stone philosophers been questin for on reddit threads, all in vain even with their epic art to bind volatile hermes and summon old proteus in jelly shapes from the sea, drained out through a lame limbeck back to his native, OG form, deadass  
so what’s the cap if fields and zones here breathe pure elixir and rivers run drinkable gold when one virtuous touch from the arch-chemick sun—so far from our squad—mixes with that earthy humor to churn out dark precious things full of glorious color and rare effects, big mood yikes  
here new matter got eye-caught by the devil, undazzled af, as his peepers commanded far and wide, no shade or obstacle in sight, only blazing sun-shine like noon beams from the equator shoot straight up so no shadow can even ghost his body, and the clear air sharpens his vision like a filter on high, soon spotting within his ken a glorious angel standin, the same one john peeped in the sun—back turned but brightness still poppin, caught in epic 4k  
a golden tiara of beamin’ sunny rays circled his dome and his rad locks on his shoulders flapped like winged gifs on a major charge, deep in cogitation, on that next level vibe  
mad hype was the impure spirit, now hopein to find who might steer his wild flight to paradise, man’s top crib and our new drama kickoff, yeet  
but first he yeets a shape-shift ‘cause sticking with his OG form might spell danger or delay, smh  
and now pops up a young cherub, not prime but with that celestial youth glow smilin on his face and all limbs drippin grace as if he feigned perfection, deadass  
under a tiny crown his flowy curls bounced on each cheek while his wings flexed colorful plumes sprinkled with gold dust like rare loot, his speed-fit habit held a silver wand, pure magic on deck  
he didn’t roll up all hush-hush; the bright angel, even before drawin near, had his radiant mug flipped after his ear caught savage beats, instantly known as the arch-angel uriel, one of the seven who chill in god’s presence, nearest to that divine throne, ever-ready on command as his extra eyes rove every corner of heaven and down to earth, droppin swift errands over moist and dry, over sea and land—then satan slides up, accostin like a notorious troll  
uriel, since you’re one of those seven spirits starin at god’s high throne, gloriously lit, you’re already his top authentick will interpreter, bringin the highest tea where all his sons vibe at your embassy, and here you’re like supreme decree, his honor on repeat, his eye visitin this fresh creation round with unspeakable FOMO to peep and know all his wonder works, but especially man—his chief delight and favor, for whom all these wild works were ordained—so he hauled me from the cherubim stacks to wander solo, brightest seraph drop the deets  
in which of these blazing orbs does man chill his fixed seat or got none, while all these orbs shine as his chosen crib so i can find him and give him that secret gaze or open admiration, on whom the great creator poured worlds and mad graces so that in him and in all, the universal maker gets our praise for drivin his rebel foes straight to deepest hell, and to patch that loss, spawned this new, happy race of men to serve him better—a wise sigma grindset all around  
so dropped the fake dissembler, unnoticed ‘cause neither man nor angel can suss out hypocrisy, that solo invisible evil ghost only god peeps through his permissive will cruisin’ heaven and earth, while sometimes even when wisdom wakes, suspicion naps at its gate and simplicity yeets her charge ‘cause goodness sees no bad, which for once had uriel, sun regent and sharpest-sighted spirit in heaven, beguiled by the fraud, and in his upright flex, he shot back at that bogus impostor  
“yo fair angel, your desire to peep god’s works to glorify the great work-master ain’t excess that brings blame but earns praise—like the extra you that dragged you hither from your empyreal mansion to peep with your own eyes what others might’ve settled for gossip in heaven; for all his works are pure wonder, mad pleasant and memory-worthy with delight, though what created mind can even count ‘em or grasp that infinite wisdom that spawned ‘em while ghosting the deep causes, fr fr”  
i peeped when at his word the formless mass—the world’s raw material mold—yeeted into a chaotic heap, confusion catchin his vocal drip and wild uproar gettin ruled as infinite chaos confined, until at his second call darkness yeeted out, light shined and order spawned from the disorder like a sudden engine yeet  
all the clunky elements—earth, flood, air, fire—yeeted to their own corners in a mad rush, while that ethereal quintessence of heaven soared upward, choppin into various forms that rolled orbicular and spun into star after star, countless as you see and moving with computed precision, each on its appointed vibe while the rest circled the universe in its circuit walls  
look down on that globe whose lit side here shines with reflected drip—that’s earth, man’s crib—where that glow gives day while the other hemisphere would be invaded by night if not for the neighboring moon (that opposite fair star) swooping in with timely aid, her monthly round ending and renewin through mid-heaven with borrowed light, her triform face fillin and emptin to enlighten the earth while she checks the night in her pale dominion  
that spot i’m pointin at is paradise, adam’s crib of lofty shades, his bower—your route is on fleek, can’t miss it, vibes say so  
so he turned and satan, bowin low like them superiors do in heaven where honor’s sacred and none disrespects, yeeted off toward the earth’s coast beneath, droppin from the ecliptic with hope on his side, throwin his steep flight in mad aery wheels and not stoppin’ ‘til he lit up on niphates’ top  

book iv

o for that warning voice, yo the one who peeped the apocalypse, heard it scream in heaven loud, deadass  
then when the dragon got second-roughed and came down furious to yeet revenge on man, oof  
woe to the earth peeps! back when our og parents got warned about their secret foe sliding in, and they lowkey escaped his mortal snare, haply escapin all that drama for now  
satan, first lit with rage, yeeted down—the tempter before turning into mankind’s savage accuser—to drop loss on fragile, innocent man for that first brutal brawl and his epic flight to hell, big yikes  
yet not hyped on his speed, even though he was bold and fearless from afar without cause to boast, he kicked off his dire try which got his chest churnin like a devil engine on the fritz, then like a twisted machine, his own chaos recoiled on him, horror and doubt distractin his thoughts, stirring the hell within, ‘cause he carries his own hell inside and no matter how he yeets, you can’t escape that inner inferno, on god  
now his dormant conscience wakes up in epic despair, flashin bitter memories of what he was, is, and what must be even worse—where worse deeds call for even worse sufferings, for real, deadass  


yo sometimes headin toward eden which now in his view be chillin like a retro vibe station but lowkey sad af cuz his mug’s all grievin and sus then sometimes he peeps up toward heaven with that full-blazing sun flexin way up in the mid-day skibidi tower deadass yo then he starts spinnin in endless sighs like “omg, mood” 

yo, o thou who got that surpassin glory crown flexin like the ultimate godmode boss of this brand new world where all the stars dip their tiny caps cuz they’re deadass shook at your presence i holla at you but in a no-friendly voice vibe and drop your name like “sun!” just to roast your beams cuz they keep remindin me of when i was mega up there above your sphere back in the days before pride and extra ambition yeeted me straight down in a wild heaven brawl against heaven’s matchless king fr fr wherefore tho dude didn’t deserve any of this savage return cuz he made me what i was in that bright flex zone without throwin no shade or hard grind on his service but then like what could be lower than droppin praises easy mode and thanks on him cuz all his good vibes turned toxic in me and cooked up nothing but pure malice as i blew up so high i disdained any subservient drip thinkin one more yeet would crown me supreme and cancel that endless gratitude debt that kept me payin like mad, forgettin all the epic loot i still got from him and not gettin that a dank mind don’t owe but pays—debt cleared in one smooth freakin move so if destiny had yeeted me as a lesser angel i’d have been chill and happy with no unbounded hope raised by ambition yet why wouldn’t some other epic power have drawn me in even if i was mean lol but other powers stayed unshaken like npc vibes armed against every temptation so if you had that free will flex to stand then who or what are you roastiin but heaven’s free love dished out equally to all so be his love accursed cuz whether it’s love or hate it drops eternal woe on me nah cursed be you since you chose your own vibe which now you be judgin hard 

damn me miserable yo which way do i yeet out—toward infinite wrath or infinite despair? whichever way i fly it’s a straight-up hell vibe cuz i am the hell itself and in the lowest deep of low vibes a deeper glitch awaits to snatch me like, and ironically the hell i suffer feels like a fake heaven so then can anyone just chill and relent cuz is there even a corner left for repentance any pardon left? nada but submission and that cringe word which i straight up despise cuz my shame’s on blast among the lower spirits i once seduced with extra promises and bogus vaunts claimin i could subdue the omnipotent flex yo ay me they don’t even know how deep i ride that vain boast under brutal inner torments while they stan me on the hell throne, deadass 

with his diadem and vibe scepter advanced i still drop lower yet remain supreme in misery—a twisted kinda joy only ambition serves up but say if i flipped the script and repented to snag my old act-of-grace drip how fast would the high squad slam back those elevated thoughts and unsay all that phony submission swear? quick as a glitch pain-made vows would bounce off like void, coz true reconcilement can never sprout where wounds of deadly hate cut deadass deep which would only have me crash harder into a worse relapse and sterner fall so i’d be payin double for a short break that burned my soul hard

my punisher straight up knows this so far from grantin peace like i’m beggin for mercy all hope got yeeted out and instead behold we outcast exiled become his brand new flex—mankind cooked up just for him and this whole world is his new playground so farewell hope and peace out fear with hope farewell remorse cuz all the good vibes in my ledger are ghost now evil be my new good cause with you i still split an empire with heaven’s king and maybe even run more than half it as man soon and this wild new world be lit, no cap

while he spittin his savage lines each passion dimmed his face switchin thrice like pale, ire, envy, and straight-up despair wreckin his borrowed drip and betraying his counterfeit self for any pixel that caught his 4k mess cuz heavenly minds from such foul distempers stay crystal clear and he peeped soon that every glitch in his mood got smoothed out on the outside like a perfect scam artist flexin fraud; he was the first to rock falsehood under that saintly glow with deep malice wrapped in revenge gear yet not enough to fool uriel who once threw shade with his eagle eye following him down that glitch path on the assyrian mount and saw him so disfigured more than any spirit snack could get his gestures fierce and his mad drip all alone as if he thought he was unseen secret mode

so on he ghosted forth to the border of eden where that delish paradise chillin like a 420 dream now closer and crowned by a mad green enclosure like a rural mound showing off the ultimate champaign head of a steep wild zone with hairy sides overgrown like tangled bush trolls so access was totally denied and overhead rose an insuperable height of loftiest shady vibes cedar and pine and fir and branching palm in a sylvan scene and as the layers stacked shade on shade it became a woody theatre of epic views yet above all that came the lush, verdurous wall of paradise upsprung high which gave our general sire a massive view into his nether empire all around and above that wall a circling row of dopest trees loaded with the fairest, most flex fruit and blossoms poppin in golden hues with enamelled, gay mix-colours on which the sun dropped his beams extra gladder than during a fire-evening cloud or humid rainbow vibe when god showered the earth so lush it made that landskip look on point and pure air hit his approach inspiring heart-level vernal joy to yeet away all sadness but despair while gentle gales fanned odoriferous wings dispensed native perfumes and whispered about stolen balmy loot like when those who flopped beyond the cape of hope and are now past mozambick get hit with northeast winds blasting sabean spices from araby’s bomb shore with such chill delay they slack their course and many leagues get hyped by old ocean smiles so entertained were those odorous sweets that even the fiend caught their vibe—though he was more down with them than asmodeus with that fishy stank that yeeted him from tobit’s son’s spouse drama and had him vengeance-sent from media post to egypt, fast bound, deadass

now satan clutched his savage vibe and started the slow, pensive trek up that steep, untamed hill but found no further route cuz it was thick AF with tangled shrubs and bush mazes messin up any route for man or beast like full maze mode one sole gate stood lookin east on the flip side which our arch-felon peeped and then straight-up disdained cuz entrance wasn’t lit so with total contempt he launched himself in one insane flight over every hill hump or sky-high wall with lights on his feet like a prowlin wolf huntin for new prey after starvin and scoping shepherds penning their flocks at eve in secure, hurdled cotes then leaping o’er fences like it was all norm or like a slick thief on a cash heist scaling rich burghers’ cross-barred, bolted doors climbin in through windows or over tiles so this primo grand thief clomb into god’s own fold like lewd hirelings creepin in church and then soared up to the tree of life—yeah that middle tall tree rockin the highest vibes—sat like some ironic cormorant but nah it wasn’t true life regained just a chill spot schemin death on those livin while ignoring the virtue drip of that life-givin plant only used for the prospect of that immortality pledge so little peeps know but god alone can truly value the good before him while everyone else just flips the best into the worst abuse or the meanest hustle

beneath him he now vibed at a new wonder—all human senses maxed out in a tight room showin nature’s entire wealth like a literal heaven on earth cuz god’s blissful paradise was his garden planted east of eden with eden stretchin her line from auran eastward to the royal towers of great seleucia built by ancient grecian kings or where eden’s original sons once kicked it in telassar in this chill soil god ordained his far more lit garden where outta that fertile ground grew all trees of the noblest drip for sight smell taste and smack in the middle stood the tree of life high up rockin ambrosial fruit of veggold and right next to life our death the tree of knowledge grew quick droppin that knowledge of good bought on learnin ill vibes southward through eden rolled a massive river that never switched up its course but busted through that shaggy hill all engulfed cuz god chucked that mountain as a high garden-mold over the rapid current which, sucked up through porous earth veins thirstin hard, rose as a fresh fountain with mad rills that watered the garden then all the streams merged tumblin down the steep glade to meet the nether flood that from its dark passage now pops and then, split into four main streams, ran all over wanderin through a bunch of famous realms and countries that don’t even need a deep account but rather serve up that tea on how from that sapphire fount the crisp brooks rolled on oriental pearls and golden sands with maze-like errors under dangle shades running straight nectar feeding every plant and hookin up flowers worthy of paradise not in some curated art beds but nature’s own boomin profuse flow on hill and dale and plain both where the morning sun first smote the open field and where that unpierced shade browned the noontide hangouts so this place became a happy rural seat of endless views groves where rich trees drip odorous gums and balm and others with fruit burnished with golden rinds hung all amiable servin up hesperian fables that are true if true only here and served straight up with delicious taste, deadass.

betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks, deadass chillin’ like npc herders on that tender herb flexing every drip, were interposed, yeet—a palmy hill, or the flowery lap of some irriguous valley gone wild, spreadin’ its store like a savage drip drop, flowers in every hue and that rose be straight-up no-thorn, big yikes for basic beauty

on the flip side, yo, there’s umbrageous grots and dank caves, secret chill zones where the mantling vine drops its purple grape like a skibidi flex, gently creepin’ luxurious af while murmuring waters fall in glitch-mode down slope hills, dispersed like random stream clout or pooling in a lake that, with its myrtle-crowned fringed bank and crystal mirror vibes, unites streams like a rom-com of nature—deadass

the birds squad up their wild quire, airs and vernal breezes droppin’ that field and grove smell so lit they attune trembling leaves; meanwhile, universal pan links up with graces and hours in a full-on dance sesh, leading eternal spring like it’s the ultimate cosmic rave—on god fr fr, pure sigma vibes

and nah, not that fair enna field where proserpine was out here snagging flowers like a meme queen, being a fairer flower herself in gloomy dis mode (which cost ceres all that pain searchin’ across the globe, smh), nor that sweet grove of daphne by orontes with the inspired castalian spring flexing extra hard, tryin’ to compete with this paradisiacal eden-style drip; nor that nyseian isle, all girt with river triton, where old cham—whom gentiles call ammon and libyan jove—was lowkey hiding amalthea and her florid son young bacchus from stepdame rhea’s ever-watchful eye, like straight stealth mode

and also not where them abassin kings be guardin’ their squad on mount amara—though some squad claims it’s the true paradise under the ethiop line by nilus’ head, wrapped in shinin’ rock over a whole day’s journey, mad remote from this assyrian garden—where the fiend peeped, undelighted, all kinds of living creatures, fresh to the scene and hella strange, including two majestic forms, erect and tall, godlike flexers rockin’ native honor in naked majesty, straight-up lords of all, worthy as their divine looks broadcast the maker’s image, dripping truth, wisdom, and severe sanctitude (severe but with that true familial freedom vibe) that spawned legit authority in men; though not equal cuz his contemplation and valour met her softness and sweet, attractive grace—he for god only, she for god in him—his broad front and sublime eye declaring absolute rule while his hyacinthine locks, manly as heck, hung clustered ‘round his parted forelock (but not smushed beneath broad shoulders) and she, like a lit veil succumbing to her slender waist, rocked unadorned golden tresses in wild, wanton ringlets—vibing like tendrils of a curling vine implying subjection yet requiring that gentle sway, yielding coyly with modest pride and a sweet, reluctant, amorous delay

and yo, none of those mysterious parts were concealed back then—there was no guilty shame, no dishonest shame in nature’s works, no honor getting dissed or sin-bred drama; so how have y’all twisted mankind with empty shows of seeming pure, banishing man’s happiest life, his simplicity and spotless innocence? big yikes fr

so they cruised on naked, not even dodging the sight of god or angel—they weren’t on that shady vibe at all; hand in hand they vibed, the loveliest duo ever to hit love’s embrace, with adam crowned the goodliest man since forever and his sons and eve, the fairest of her daughters, serving that ultimate power couple flex

under a scrappy tuft of shade on a green whispering spot by a fresh fountain, they sat down to chill; after just enough gardening grind to spark cool zephyr feels and make ease even easier, their thirst and appetite hit next level, so they dove into those supper-fruits—nectarine treats dished out by compliant boughs while they reclined side-long on that soft, downy bank damasked with wild floral drip; munching that savory pulp and scooping up the brimming stream while still thirsting, with no gentle purpose or endearing smile lacking, nor any youthful dalliance missing—just the fair couple locked in a happy nuptial league solo, while all the earthly beasties went wild: every chase critter from woods to wilderness, forest to den, with lions ramping and play-finessing a kid in his paw, bears, tigers, ounces, leopards gambolling like mad, and even an unwieldy elephant flexin’ all his might to drop some mirth by wreathing his lithe proboscis; even a sly serpent got in there, insinuating and weaving his gordian twine braid, dropping fatal guile proofs that went unheeded, while others lounged on the grass, either chillin’ with pasture gazing or ruminating bedward 'cause the sun was bouncin’, hasting on a prone career to the ocean isles, and the ascending scale of heaven saw stars usher the evenin’ rose like a total throwback

when satan, still in that savage gaze as he first stood, almost lost his speech but then recovered all sad and glitchy, o hell! what do my eyes behold in grief? into our room of bliss advanced high up, creatures of another mold—earth-born maybe, not full spirits but little inferior to heavenly sparkles—whom my thoughts chase in wonder and might even love, cause they shine with that divine resemblance and the epic grace that the maker poured on their shapes, legit vibes

ah, gentle pair, y’all got zero clue how near your switch-up is comin’, when all these delights gonna vanish and drop you straight into woe; more woe the more your taste’s addicted to joy—happy now but so insecurely happy that you long to ride it forever, and this high seat you call heaven is flimsy af to keep out foes that are already crashin’ the party; yet no foe’s specifically targetin’ you, whom i pity in your forlorn state (even if i unpity sometimes)—so i’m tryna lock in a league with you, a mutual amity so tight and lit that either i live with you or you with me henceforth; my crib might not scream paradise like your vibe, but accept your maker’s work, ‘cuz he gave it to me and i give it free: hell is ready to open her widest gates to entertain you two, sendin’ out all her kings—there’ll be room not like these narrow limits for your massive offspring; and if there ain’t a better spot, thank the dude who puts me in a loth mood to take revenge on y’all who ain’t even wronging me for him who did—straight chaotic energy

and if i melt over your harmless innocence like i always do, but public reason, honor, and empire with revenge supercharged make me wanna conquer this new world, then i’m compelled to do what else, even though it’s damned stuff i’d normally abhor—pure mess, no cap

so spake the fiend, and by necessity, the tyrant’s plea excused his devilish deeds; then from his high-key perch on that tall tree he yeeted down among the sportful herd of four-footed kinds, switching shape like bonkers—now one, now another—as their forms served his endgame to get closer to his prey, unespied so he could scope out more deets by word or action; around them, a lion started stalkin’ with a fiery glare, then, like a tiger who by chance peeped two gentle fawns at play in some random purlieu, immediately crouched close and then kept switching his couchant watch like a boss who picked his turf—ready to rush and snatch them both, grippin’ each in his paws; when adam, first of men, started droppin’ smooth speech to first of women, eve, he turned his head, all ears up to soak in the new drip of vibes

sole partner and sole bae in all these joys, you’re more precious than anything; the power that made us and this sprawling world gotta be infinitely good and as free as the infinite itself—lifting us from dust and placing us in this epic happiness even though we haven’t earned a thing, and we can’t perform any extra hustle, only required to keep this chill charge: to guard every tree in paradise that bears a crazy variety of delicious fruit, not to taste that one forbidden tree of knowledge planted by the tree of life—so death, whatever that dread thing is, stays near life; no cap, god pronounced that tasting that tree equals death, the only sign left of our obedience among so many signs of power and rule he dropped on us, givin’ us dominion over every other creature on earth, air, and sea. so let’s not stress one easy prohibition when we got free leave for nearly everything and unlimited picks of joy; instead, let’s forever praise him and extol his bounty, following our delightful task to prune these growing plants and tend these flowers—even if it’s toilsome, with you it’s sweet af

to whom eve clapped back, “o thou for whom and from whom i was formed, flesh of thy flesh, and without whom i’m done, my guide and head! what thou hast said is pure just and right. for we owe him all our praises and daily thanks; i, especially, who enjoy a happier lot by enjoying thee pre-eminent by such crazy odds while thou, like a solo consort, canst find nowhere else.” 

that day i still remember, when from sleep i first awoke and found myself chillin’ under a shady burst on flowers, wonderin’ where and what i was, where i was brought from, and how it all went down; not far from that spot, i heard a murmuring sound of waters comin’ outta a cave and spreadin’ into a liquid plain, always unmoved, pure like the heavens’ expanse—so i bounced over there with zero pregame thought and laid down on the green bank to peep into the clear, smooth lake that seemed like another sky to me

as i bent down to look, straight opposite a shape within the watery gleam popped up, bending to peep at me—i yeeted back, it yeeted back; but mad soon, i rolled back in, pleased ‘cause it returned with sympathetic, lovey looks, pure mutual drip; there i locked my eyes for a long minute, pining with vain desire—had it not been for a voice dropping a warning, “what thou seest, what there thou seest, fair creature, is thyself; with thee it comes and goes: but follow me, and i will bring thee where no shadow sticks to thy arrival, and thy soft embraces be for he whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy inseparably, to him shalt bear multitudes like thyself, and thence be called mother of the human race.” what could i do but follow straight up, invisibly led, yeet mode engaged!

till i peeped u, deadass tall n flexin vibe, legit beauty on fleek, yo  
chillin under that platane, but tbh that tree was basic, lowkey just npc, k?  
its soft vibes were mid compared to that liquid drip of pure flex, no cap  
i yeeted my view, spun back like a glitch in the matrix  
u then hollered, “yo come back, fair eve!” like high-key, “return, bestie!”  
who u yeeting from? fr, clearly u stan his whole kit n caboodle, roped in his drip  
i loaned u my flesh n bone, straight out my heart’s core, deadass homie  
gave u that substantial life force so u could ride by my side, legit ride or die  
from that moment, u became my one and only solaced bae, my other half, squad goals  
u reached out with that gentle, soft hand and i straight up yeeted into ur grasp  
that moment proved how beauty levels get boosted by mad manly drip and real wisdom, on god  
so our general mama dropped the truth, eyes blazing with that no cap conjugal attraction,  
half-hugging our original daddy while her bomb bust met his, naked under that gold drip of loose tresses,  
and he was vibin hard on her beauty and submissive meme charms, flashing superior love like jupiter on juno when he’s sprinklin mayflowers and pressing her matron lip with pure, straight-up kisses, skrrt  
meanwhile, the devil, all envious and shady with a jealous leer, peeped them like “yo, this is extra” then lowkey started his melt-down monologue, smh  

sight hateful and totally tormenting, these two were stuck in each other’s arms like a glitchy eden—max on bliss over bliss—while i get yeeted straight to hell where there’s no joy or love, just fierce desire burnin hard among other torments, leaving a constant ache like unfulfilled pain drip, deadass  
but hold up, i ain’t forgettin what i snagged from their own lip spit: not all is theirs, fr; one fatal tree standin there called knowledge, totally forbidden for them to snack on, sus and reasonless as heck—why should their lord be jelly of that drip? can knwin be sin or even death? are they just chillin in ignorance, thinkin that’s the happy state and proof of obedience and faith? oof, foundation of ruin, so extra! so i’m gon’ hype their minds with mad desire to know more and yeet those envious commands that were made just to keep them low-key while knowledge would have them flex equal with gods—aspirin to be chads, but they taste and die, what else can go down?  

but first, i gotta peep every corner of this garden, no nook left unscoped, deadass on a narrow search for any wandering spirit of heaven chillin by a fountain side or posted in thick shade, just to snatch any extra tea to learn more—live while u can, happy pair, enjoy those short pleasures ‘cause long woes are coming, fr  
so sayin that, he yeeted his proud step in scornful mode, but with sly scout-mode, began roamin’ through woods, waste, over hill and dale, his roam goin mad in utmost longitude where heaven, earth, and ocean mash up as the sun slowly slid down, droppin that perfect aspect against the eastern gate of paradise  

sun’s eve rays were leveled on a rock of alabaster piled high to the clouds, a far-out flex winding up in one lit ascent, accessible by one high entrance while the rest was a craggy, overhung cliff that rose impossible to scale, absolute glitch clout  
betwixt these rocky pillars, gabriel sat chillin’ as chief of angel squad, waiting for night while the unarmed youth of heaven played hero-level games around him—celestial armoury with shields, helms, n spears hung high, diamond flaming n gold drip on deck, straight fire  
then uriel glided in on a sunbeam, swift like a shooting star in that autumn night when vapours fired and impressed the air, showin the mariner which compass angle to dodge impetuous wind vibes—so he dipped in mad haste  

gabriel, yo, thy course by lot was set: keep strict watch so no evil vibe sneaks into this happy place, squad verified only  
that day at high noon, a zealous spirit slid into my sphere, straight up tryna know more of the almighty’s works and chiefly man—god’s freshest image; i peeped his speedy, aery strut which was all on warp speed, but up on that mount north of eden where he first dropped light, his look came off all alien with some foul, obscured passion, glitch af  
my eye tracked him, but under shade his vibe got lost, and one of the banished crew, i fear, ventured from the deep to stir up fresh drama—yo, u gotta track that troublemaker, fam, since the winged warrior just yeeted back to him  

uriel, no wonder with that eagle-eye if u can peep the sun’s bright circle where u sit, seeing far and wide: at this gate, none pass except those well-known from heaven—since meridian hour, no creature’s creepin; if some other spirit, on purpose, tries to yeet over these earthly bounds, hard rule excludes spiritual substance with a corporeal bar, yo  
but if within these circuits any shape lurks, whatevs u say, by dawn i’ll peep who it is, no cap  
so he promised that, and uriel bounced back on that bright beam, which now raised and yeeted him down the slope to the fallen sun beneath the azores—whether the prime orb rolled there on a diurnal sprint or this less voluble earth left him there by a shorter eastern flight, arraying with reflected purple n gold clouds on his western throne, pure insta-filter flex  

now came still evening, and twilight gray draped everything in sober livery, silence ghostin’ as beasts and birds yeeted to their grassy nests—everyone except that hyper wakeful nightingale spamming amorous descants all night, while silence itself was vibin as the firmament glowed with living sapphires; hesperus led the starry host, ridin brightest until the moon rose in clouded majesty, finally unveiling her peerless light and droppin her silver mantle o’er the dark, full-on queen mode  

when adam hit up eve, his fair consort, it was that nocturnal hour, all things chillin in rest mode, so keep it real and hit that repose ‘cause god set up that hustle and rest cycle like day and night for men—daily grind for body or mind, declaring his dignity and heaven’s boss-level regard on his moves, while other animals roam slack and god don’t even check their stats  

tomorrow, before fresh morn streaks the east like fire, we gotta bounce, rising like viral dance to our chill hustle of replantin yon flowery arbours, yonder green alleys—our noon walk through overgrown branches that roast our scarce manure game and need way more squad hands to lop that wild growth, plus those extra blossoms and fallen gums littered all rough and unsmooth askin’ for a cleanup if we tryna tread easy; meanwhile, as nature wills, night bids us hit that rest mode  

so eve, lookin all perf with that beauty flex, told my author n disposer, “what u say, i obey, no args”—so god’s the law, u mine, and knowing no more is the ultimate happy knowledge for a woman, mad praise  
with u, i forget time—seasons and their mood changes all blend into one sweet vibe; morn’s breath is sugary, her rise lit like the charm of the earliest birds, and the sun when it first splashes his orient beams on herb, tree, fruit, n flower glistening with dew, while the fertile earth smells dank after soft showers, and the coming of grateful, mild evening is as sweet as silent night with that solemn bird vibe, fair moon, n all the heavenly gem starry train, legit cosmic bling  
but neither the breath of morn when she ascends with that first bird charm nor the risin sun on this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, flower dripping dew, nor that post-shower fragrance, nor grateful mild eve, nor silent night with its solemn bird, nor a moonlit stroll, or glitterin star-light is ever as sweet without u, bae  
but why all that glow all night though? for who’s this epic sight when sleep shuts all eyes?  

our og ancestor clapped back, “daughter of god and man, ace eve, these got their path to finish circlin’ the earth by tomorrow eve, from land to land in order, even for nations not yet born—ministring light prepped, they set n ride, so total darkness don’t come snuff out life in nature ‘cause these soft fires not only enlighten but drop that kindly heat to warm, nourish, and drip their stellar virtue on all that grows on earth, making it ready to soak up the sun’s potent ray of perfection.”  

so even if they stay unseen deep in night, they ain’t shinin’ in vain; don’t think heaven needs spectators or that god wants clout—millions of spiritual creatures be stalkin’ the earth, unseen whether we wake or sleep, all droppin’ ceaseless praise on his dope works day n night; how often, from steep echo hills or thickets, have we peeped celestial voices spillin’ into the midnight air, solo or in responsive bands, singin’ about the great creator while they keep watch or round up on nightly strolls, blending in heavenly instrumental sounds in full harmonic squad mode that splits the night and lifts our thoughts to heaven, real talk  

thus chattin’ hand in hand, they yeeted on to their blissful bower—a spot chosen by the sovran planter when he framed all things for man’s delightful use; the roof was thick covert all woven in shade with laurel and myrtle, plus whatever higher grew with firm, fragrant leaves, and on each side acanthus and every odorous bushy shrub fenced up the lush wall—each beauteous flower, iris in all hues, roses, and jessamin, pure flex for the ages…

yo they popped up with their extra heads flexin’ between the vibes and built a dope mosaic all extra—with violets, crocus, and hyacinths drippin’ in rich inlay that made the ground glow-up harder than the dopest stone drip, no cap emblem-level expensive, fr fr; and yo, not a single critter—bird, beast, insect, or even a worm—had the guts to step into that zone ‘cause they were shook by man, deadass. in a shady af hideout, all sacred and locked down even if kinda posey, pan or sylvanus never caught z’s, nor did any nymph or faunus ghost the spot. here in that tight recess with flower drips, garland clout, and herbs smellin’ like pure fire, eve straight-up prepped her nuptial flex, decking her bed like a new drip launch, squad goals only!

and then the heavenly quires dropped a lit hymn on that wedding vibe, spillin’ the tea about the day when that genial angel rolled up to our sire and hauled in eve—naked but on fleek with extra drip, way lovelier than pandora, who the gods loaded up with all their fire gifts, o! and lowkey, same sad tea when hermes rolled with japhet’s unwiser son and she snared mankind with her pure flex looks to serve savage revenge on the dude who jacked jove’s authentick fire, yeet!

so they rolled up at the shady crib, both standin’ and spinnin’ under that open sky, straight-up worshippin’ the big boss god who crafted the sky, air, earth, and the whole heaven vibe—peepin’ the moon’s glow-up and that starry pole that slaps. yo, u too—the ultimate night maker, the omnipotent drip commander—and u whipped up the day as well, which we clocked finishing our grind, happy af in our mutual help and love, the epic crown of our bliss pre-ordained by u, fr fr; and this bomb spot? legit too extra for us, where your abundance overflows while some parts get left uncropped on the ground, no cap!

but yo u promised a duo-level race to fill up the earth who’d be droppin’ endless praise for u, infinite flex on your good vibes, both when we vibe awake and when we hit that sleep mode right now—deadass!

so, all on the same wavelength, no extra rituals but straight-up pure worship—the kinda adoration god vibes with the most—the squad dipped into their inner hideout and yeeted off those lame-ass disguises we always wear, layin’ ‘em off side by side, and guess what? adam didn’t ditch his bae, nor did eve ghost on that mysterious connubial love vibe. like, whatever those extra ice-nosed haters be preachin’ ‘bout purity, space, and innocence, dissing what god calls pure and drops as free swag for all, that talk is extra bogus, on god.

our maker be like “grow up and get lit, my dudes,” while our destroyer be the full enemy—not just to god but to man too, lol. salute to wedded love, that mysterious law and original source of human clout, the only proper drip in paradise compared to all the other common af stuff! ‘cause, like, through your cray adulterous lust, men were yeeted into beastly herds, and by u the vibe of rational, loyal, just, and pure connections—the tight fam of father, son, and bro—was first uncuffed, no cap.

ain’t me gonna diss u with sin or blame or say u ain’t the holiest af crib, the perpetual fountain of domestick sweets, whose bed stays undefiled and chaste like it’s forever on saint mode, both present and past as the old heads used to flex. here, love drops his golden zaps, lights his nonstop lamp, and flaps those purple wings, reppin’ and throwin’ ragers; not in the bought smile of loveless, joyless, unendeared harlots or in those court-amours, mixed-up dances, wild mask-ups, midnight bops, or even the serenade a starvin’ lover sings to his high-key fair bae while dishing disdain, big yikes!

these peeps, lulled by nightingale vibes, got their snug mode on, and on their au naturel limbs the flowery roof dropped a rose rain which the morn squad patched up real quick. sleep on, bless up duo; and oh! y’all are the happiest if u ain’t on the hunt for any extra hype state and are chill with not knowing no mo’, fr fr.

now night had clocked her shadow cone halfway up the hill in this vast sublunar drop zone, and from their ivory port the cherub squad popped out at the usual hour, kitted out for their night patrol in straight war mode. then gabriel, flexin’ as the top-tier og, dropped some words to his next-level homies.

uzziel, yo, split the crew—half to hold down the south with strict AF watch, and the others to spin north; our squad circuit hit full west. as flames split, half pivotin’ to the shield, half to the spear, from this wild mix he called his two strong, sneaky spirit homies chillin’ nearby and dropped, “yo, this is your charge, deadass.”

ithuriel and zephon, wings on turbo, crashed through this lit garden, leavin’ no nook unsearched, especially where those two fine cuties were posted, maybe catchin’ z’s and hella safe from any harm, on god!

this evening, from the sun’s epic dip, rolled in a messenger spillin’ tea ‘bout some infernal spirit, bent on comin’ here (dude, who would’ve thought?) that yeeted outta hell’s bars on some shady errand, no doubt—like, when u spot that sus vibe, grab it fast and yeet it here ASAP.

so, spittin’ savage vibes, he led his radiant crew, dazzlin’ the moon as he sent ‘em to the secret crib to search for their target. they peeped him posted squat like a toad near eve’s ear, tryna, with his devil-level art, get into the organs of her fantasy and forge mad trippy illusions, phantasms, dreams—like, if his venom inspo could taint her animal spirit vibes that bubble from her pure blood, gentle like fresh river breezes, then he’d spark off all that distempered, discontent, vain hope, wild aim, and extra desires blown up with major conceit and pride, legit.

so with that wild intent, ithuriel yeeted his spear to tap him lightly—‘cause no fake vibe can survive a celestial touch without bouncing back in its own form, on god. he popped up, discovered and caught off guard, like when a lit spark hits a stash of nitrous powder prepped for a sus war flex and that grimy grain goes boom, full sudden blaze lighting up the air; so the fiend got lit in his own savage shape, straight up.

in a flash, those two dope angels bounced back, half amazed to spot the grimy king, but they stayed chill with zero fear and closed in on him pronto, like “yo which rebel spirit from hell yeeted outta your prison and switched up, sittin’ here like an enemy on standby watchin’ over these snoozers?”

“yo—don’t u know me?” spat satan, dripping major scorn, “u knew me back in the day, no mate for u, sittin’ where u’d never dare to fly—if u don’t know me then u’re straight unknown, the lowest of the throng; or if u do know, why even ask and spill extra drama that ends up all in vain?” then zephon clapped back, answerin’ scorn with scorn, deadass.

don’t even think, you twisted spirit, that your shape is still the same or that your glow still on peak like when u were upright and pure in heaven—that glory dipped when u lost the good vibe, and now u straight-up look like all u got is sin and that dark doom hangover, mad foul. but yo, for real, buckle up ‘cause u gotta answer to the one who sent us, whose job is to lock down this crib inviolable and keep our squad safe from harm, on god.

so the cherub dropped that savage line, his rebuke all grave and severe with that youthful beauty and invincible grace—meanwhile, the devil got all abashed, feelin’ how epic goodness is, peepin’ virtue lookin’ all lovey-dovey; he even got salty over his loss but mostly got hit with seein’ his own shine dimmed, yet he stayed undaunted. “if i gotta throw down,” he said, “best to battle with the best—the sender vibes, not just the receiver—or mix it up; either more glory is snagged or less is dropped. your fear, bruh, will save us ‘cause even the weakest peep can go solo against your wickedness and all that soft weak energy,” zephon boldly chimed in.

the fiend clammed up, completely overcome with rage; but like a proud stallion on locked reins, he kept strutting all haughty, chompin’ on his iron curb—whether to hustle or yeet, his vibe was straight-up vain. awe from above iced his heart so hard, nothing else could shake him. then they drew near to the western tip, where the half-circling guards had just linked up in a tight squad, waiting for the next order. then their chief, gabriel, from the front, hollered out loud.

yo fam! i hear nimble kicks hustlin’ this way, and i just peeped ithuriel and zephon slidin’ through the shade; rollin’ with them came a third dude with regal port vibes, though his faded splendor was kinda sus—as his swagger and fierce demeanour screamed prince of hell, not about to yeet out without a proper beef. so squad up and stand firm ‘cause his look reeks of pure defiance, big yikes.

he barely finished his spiel when those two slid up close, quickly spillin’ who they scooped and where they found him, dishin’ all the tea on how busy he was and in what wild form he was posted. then gabriel, all stern and legit, dropped his next words, no cap.

“why did u, satan, break our set bounds with your extra transgressions and mess with the charge of others who ain’t down to flex your rule-breaking, but actually got the power and right to call out your bold entrance into this crib—where it seems the plan was to lock in sleep and protect those whose crib god planted here in bliss, deadass?”

to which satan, with a major contempt face, clapped back, “gabriel? back in heaven u had all the wise respect, and i legit had that for u; but this question got me in deep doubt—who loves their own pain? who wouldn’t bust out of hell if they could, even if doomed? u’d straight-up yeet yourself and boldly jump to any chill zone farthest from pain, where u might swap torment for easy recompense dished out with delight—something i was chasin’ here; so u got no reason if u only know the good and haven’t flexed with evil yet, and u’d object your own will that’s caging us. let him lock his iron gates tighter if he wants us stuck in that dark durance—yo, that’s as much as was asked. the rest is true, i was found where they say, but that ain’t meanin’ violence or harm.”

then, in total scorn, the warlike angel danced, half-smirkin’ disdainfully as he replied, “oh man, such a loss of one in heaven to judge the wise ever since satan fell, overthrown by his own folly, and now crawlin’ back from his prison-break, all gravely unsure whether to call y’all wise or not—y’all ask what wild boldness got him here, unlicensed from his hell-ass bounds. he reckons it’s smart to bounce from pain anyway, to yeet out of his punishment!”

“so keep judgin’, you arrogant misfit, until the wrath u stirred by your own flyin’ yeets meets you sevenfold and slams that dumb wisdom back to hell—‘cause it never schooled u any better, like, no pain matches infinite anger provoked. but why u solo? why didn’t u squad up with full hell break loose? is their pain less, easier to yeet away, or what? like, are u the only one gettin’ it, or what, deadass?”



less hardy to endure? courageous chief! yo, less hardy to endure, deadass, courageous chief, flexin’ on pain like “skrrt, yeet that hurt” and all that—first to dip from pain, legit alleged to your ghost crew that fleeing was the move, but no cap you ain’t the lone fugitive, bruh.

to which the fiend snapped back with that stern, dissing glare, “bro, not sayin’ i shrink from pain, ya salty angel npc—i was on that hardcore, lit battle grind, blasting thunder like a skibidi storm, secondin’ your weak-ass spear hustle, for real.”

but yo, your random drip of words are sus af, throwin’ shade on your noob moves from past failed tries, like you ain’t ever been a faithful leader ready to risk it all solo in danger zones you never even beta-tested—so i, solo, went full giga-chad and yeeted my way into the desolate abyss to spy on this brand new world where even in hell fame ain’t ghostin’—i’m tryna cop a better crib and flex my busted powers on earth or even mid-air, no cap—even if you and your extra, drip-loaded legions dare step up.

meanwhile, those clout-chasin’ fiends were all about servin’ their lord up high in heaven with extra cheesy hymns and cringe distance moves, not fightin’ but just bendin’ the knee, and then the warriour angel dropped the ultimate clapback: talkin’ all mess about “say it then unsay it,” actin’ like a boss who dodges pain and spies around, basically callin’ out a false leader—a liar traced to satan, yo—and damn, you tryin’ to add that faithful tag? o name, o sacred name of that profaned loyalty—big yikes!

faithful to who, bro? your rebellious, extra fiend crew, body to head match-up, all military drillin’ to ditch allegiance to the supreme boss vibes. and you, sneaky hypocrite, now tryna pass as the patron of liberty—when you used to fawn, cringe, and worship heaven’s epic monarch like a total simp—all just so you could yeet him out and snatch that crown for yourself? savage plot, no cap!

but listen, avant, mark it: dont yeet from your escape route! if you pop up in these hallowed zones from now on, imma drag you back, chained to that infernal pit, sealing you up so you can’t diss the barely locked gates of hell anymore—threat level: 100, deadass! he thrown that mega threat, but satan wasn’t havin’ it—he clapped back, ramping his rage to insane levels.

then when i’m your chain-captive droppin’ mad talk, proud limitary cherub, brace yourself for that heavy load comin’ from my unstoppable arm—even if heaven’s king rides on your wings with your old squad, yoke-bound and draggin’ his triumph wheels down that star-paved heavenly roadway, yo.

while all this drip-spittin’ went down, the angel squadron, lit and bright, flipped to fiery red mode, sharpened their mooned horns like they were preppin’ for a glitch-out, and closed in on him with spears loaded like a field of ceres, ripe for harvest—her bearded grove of ears swayin’ like, “sksksk,” while the cautious plowman, straight-up shook, left his hopeless sheaves on the threshing floor like chaff in the wind, no cap.

on the flip, satan got shook, gatherin’ all his mega might, standin’ all dilated and flexin’ like teneriff or atlas, unmovable—his stature reachin’ the sky with that horrour plumed on his crest, holdin’ a spear-shield mashup that screamed “danger!” so that dreadful drama was about to go off—not just for paradise to be caught in the chaos, but maybe even heaven’s starry drip or all the elements get wrecked, torn up in violence, until the eternal, to stop the ugly fray, dangled out his golden scales between astrea and the scorpion sign, weighin’ every created thing—the round, pendulous earth balanced with airy counterpoise—ponderin’ all epic battles and realms with two weights: one for partin’ and one for fightin’. then the fight weight yeeted up quick and kicked the beam, which gabriel peeped, so the fiend went off on him, deadass.

satan, yo, i know your flex and you know mine—both our strengths ain’t our own, they’re gifted, so what’s the drip in boastin’ about what our arms can do? yours can do no more than heaven allows, and mine—even doubled—is just here to trample you like mire, no cap! peep the sky for proof, read your fate in that celestial sign where you get weighed and shown how light and weak you are if you resist—meanwhile the fiend looked up, clocked his floating scale, and dipped, murmuring away with the night’s shadows yeeted with him.

book v

now morn, with her rosy steps in the eastern clime, advanced like she was sowing the earth with orient pearl drip, when adam woke up like he normally does—his sleep was super light, aery-light from that pure digestion vibe and chill, temperate vapours—only broken by the sound of leaves, fuming rills, aurora’s fan breezin’ through, and that shrill matin bird jam on every bough, all adding to the vibe. so extra, his mind got blown findin’ unwakened eve, hair all discomposed and cheeks glowin’ like they were lit from unquiet rest. he, half up and leanin’ with those cordial love feels, hangin’ over her like a total smitten simp, peeped that beauty that shot out mad graces whether she was snoozin’ or awake—pure drip.

then she, soft as zephyrus on flora with a gentle touch, whispered, “awake, my fairest, my espoused, my latest found, heaven’s last best gift, my ever new delight!” and yo, awake: the morning shines, and the fresh field calls—like, we gotta ditch the prime time to peep how spring’s flexin’ on our tender plants, how the citron grove blows up, what drops the myrrh and the balmy reed sways in that drip, how nature be paintin’ her colours, and how the bee sits on the bloom suckin’ out that liquid sweet vibe—no cap!

such whisper woke her, but she, startled, eyed adam as she hugged him tight and then dropped, “o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, my glory, my perfection! so glad i see thy face and morn returned; ‘cause i this night (like, never had a night like this before) dreamed—not of your past day moves or tomorrow’s fresh design—but of offense and trouble my mind had never clocked till this irksome night. i swear, it was like someone whisperin’ in my ear to take a walk, gentle as heck—i thought it was you—and it said, ‘why sleepest thou, eve? now’s the pleasant time, the cool and silent moment, except where silence gets busted by that night-warbling bird droppin’ the sweetest love-song; now the full-orbed moon reigns with a pleasing light that sets off all the shadows, even if no one’s peepin’—heaven wakes all its eyes, beholdin’ none but thee, nature’s desire, whose beauty grabs all the joy and leaves peeps starstruck.’”

i bounced at that call but found you ghost, so i kept on walkin’, cruisin’ solo through wild paths until i suddenly crashed in front of that tree of interdicted knowledge, lookin’ way fresher than by day, mad appealing to my fancy. and as i was scrollin’ my mind, right there beside it stood some winged dude, like one of those heavenly types we peep all the time, his dewy locks drippin’ ambrosia—he was starin’ at that tree too and goin’, “o fair plant, with fruit surcharged, why you dissin’ a taste of your sweet drip? neither god nor man? is knowledge so clapped, or is envy blockin’ the taste? whoever forbids, none shall hold back thy offered good any longer—why else hang here?” wild af, no cap.

without pausin’, he yeeted his arm, plucked and tasted that fruit—so bold that my damp horror got chill AF at such reckless words backed by a deed so insane. but he, overjoyed, kept it 100: “o fruit divine, sweet on your own but even sweeter when cropt forbidden here, seemin’ just right for gods, yet able to turn men into gods—why not gods of men, since the more you share, the more it grows, and the author ain’t impaired but gets hella honored? here, happy creature, fair angelick eve, partake as well; even though you’re happy, you could be happier, bet—you taste this and level up among the gods, become a goddess not earth-bound but sometimes floatin’ in the air like us as we ascend to heaven on your own merit to see what lit life the gods live, and what lit life you can have too!”

so sayin’ that, he rolled up close and held that same fruit up to my mouth, sharin’ part of his plucked treasure, and the heavenly savory smell hit me so hard it boosted my appetite big time—I couldn’t resist but taste it. next thing, i was up in the clouds with him, flyin’ high while below the earth stretched out immense like one crazy prospect—wide and various, and i was wonderin’ at my epic flight and glow-up. then, outta nowhere, my guide dipped and i sank, crashed into sleep; but omg, how stoked i was to wake up and find it was just a dream! so eve spilled her nighttime tea, and adam answered all sad about it.

adam then got deep, sayin’, “best image of myself and my dear better half, the trouble of thy thoughts in this night’s sleep hits me just as hard—I can’t vibe with this ugly dream born of evil, i fear; yet where’d evil even come from? in thee, there’s no room for that, you’re created pure. but peep this: in the soul, there’s a bunch of minor faculties servin’ reason as the boss; and next up, fancy holds its gig, craftin’ all external vibes that our five watchful senses peep—she molds imaginations into airy shapes, which reason then copes with by joinin’ or disjointin’ them into what we call our knowledge or opinion, before bouncin’ back into its private cell when nature’s chill. and when fancy is MIA, it mimics itself to fill the gap, but mixin’ up shapes can throw wild, mismatched work in dreams—like words and deeds that don’t jive from way back or just lately. i swear, i peep some of that from our last evening chat in your dream, but with extra wild add-ons; so don’t get salty—evil might hit the mind of god or man, come and go without droppin’ a trace, leavin’ no spot of blame behind. that gives me hope that what you abhorred dreamin’ in sleep, when you’re awake, you’ll never roll with. so don’t get disheartened or darken that naturally chill, cheerful look that beams even brighter than when the lit morning first smiles on the world; let’s bounce to our fresh hustle among the groves, fountains, and flowers that now open up their choicest, bomb-ass bosomed smells, no cap!

yo yo, reserved from that dark vibe, kept 4 u in the secret stash fr fr, deadass  
so he hyped up his bae, and she was all lit like “big mood,” yet lowkey a single teardrop slid off in silent drip, no cap, from both eyes then she yeeted it with her hair like, “bruh, chill,”  
and two extra precious drip drops, just standin ready in their crystal flex sluices, caught pre-drop and kissed like obvious signs of sweet remorse and pious awe cuz they were straight shook about offendin, smh  
so everything got cleared, and they bounced out to the field in mad haste, like glitch mode activated  

but first, under that shady arbor drip roof, as soon as they slid out into open view, caught in 4k sunrise vibes, they peeped day-spring and the sun, who barely yeeted up, wheels still hoverin’ over that ocean-brim zone, shootin dewy rays parallel to the earth like, “no cap, check this,” discoverin in that massive landskip every east vibe of paradise and eden’s chill, happy plains—lowkey they bowed in adoration and kicked off their daily prayer flex, each morn paid up proper with all kinds of style, ‘cause style ain’t nothin when you got holy rapture on deck to praise your maker in instantly fire strains, unmediated and straight off the dome, with prompt eloquence flowin from their lips in prose or a truckload of verse, more tunable than any needed lute or harp to add that extra sweetness—so they began, full send  

yo check it, these are ur epic works, parent of all good, almighty flex, this universal frame is drippin wonder, and u yourself be wonderous AF, unspeakable in sitting high above these heavens, invisible or low-res seen in ur most basic works, yet they spill the tea on ur goodness beyond thought and that divine power, sigma vibes on max  

speak up, y’all who got the tea, sons of lit vibes, angels, ‘cause y’all peep him and drop song after song with choral symphonies, every day, no night drama, circlin his throne in pure rejoicing; on earth, join every creature to hype him—him first, him last, him mid, forever on loop  

fairest star, last rider in the night train, if u ain’t vibin with the dawn squad, for real pledge of day crowning that smiley morn with ur bright flex circlet, drop mad praise in ur sphere while day rises in that prime sweet hour, omg  

u sun, the eye and soul of this massive world, acknowledge him as ur top tier, sound off his praise along ur eternal course—whether u be climbin up high, hittin high noon, or even when u dip down low, still bump his epic beat, no cap  

yo moon, now syncing with that orient sun, now flex and fly with the fixed stars, locked in their orb vibes that cruise smooth, and u five other wandering fires, always on the move in mystic dance with fire tracks blasting his praise—he who yeeted light out of pure darkness, legit  

air, and all u elements, the OG of nature’s crib runnin in a perpetual quad-loop, multiform and mixin up everything to nourish all the vibes; let your constant, ceaseless change serve our great maker with fresh praise on repeat, deadass  

yo mists and exhalations risin up from any hill or steamin’ lake, all dusky and gray, ‘til the sun yeets gold on your fleecy skirts like an insta glow up in honor of the world’s ultimate author—whether deckin up the bland sky with clouds or drippin rain to quench the thirsty earth, risin or fallin you still push his praise, no cap  

his praise, all u winds blowin from the four corners, whether soft breeze or loud flex, and yo, wave ur tops like pines in a worship wave with every plant gettin in on the vibe  

fountains and all u that warble while flowin, droppin melodious murmurs and warblin tunes of his praise like total sick vibes  

join in, all u livin souls—birds singin mad up to the heaven gate, carryin his praise on ur wings and droppin fire notes, straight up  

u that glide through waters and u that walk the earth, whether struttin stately or creepin lowkey, witness if i go silent in the morn or even later, from hill or valley, fountain or fresh shade, my song gets vocal and teaches his praise, pure vibe alert  

hail, universal lord, stay bounteous and drop only the good vibes; and if the night’s hoardin any evil or concealin drama, disperse it like light yeets away dark, skrrt fast!  

so they prayed all innocent and got that firm peace back on lock, calm restored like trending chill, then bounced unto their morn rural grind among sweet dews and flowers where fruit-trees stretch their pampered boughs too far and need hands to check those fruitless embraces, or they led the vine to hook up with her elm—she, all spoused up, twining her marriageable arms ‘round him and droppin her dower, them adopted clusters to flex on his barren leaves, and his barren leaves got mad pityed by heaven’s high king who called out raphael, that sociable spirit who was lowkey down to ride with tobias and secure his wedding with the seventimes-wedded maid, legit squad goals  

raphael hollers, “yo, u hear that stir on earth? satan, who ghosted hell through that dark abyss, has raised chaos in paradise and got the human duo all disturbed—like he’s plottin to ruin mankind in one savage move, big yikes!”  

so go, half this day, friend with friend—chop it up with adam wherever u spot him chillin in a shady bower to escape the noon heat, get some reprieve for that day grind with a chill repast or just kick back in repose; bring that dope discourse that advises him on his happy state, happiness left to his own free will, even though his will is mad mutable—so warn him, “yo, keep it from swervin too secure,” and tell him his danger and who’s the enemy, that ex-heaven drop-out now plotting to yank others from bliss—by deceit and sus lies, not by raw violence (cos violence gets blocked hard)—so let him know or risk gettin caught off guard, no heads-up, unadmonished, and full-on willy-nilly transgressor, big yikes, for real  

so spake the eternal dad and fulfilled all justice; the winged saint didn’t even pause after catchin his charge—straight out among a thousand celestial ardors, chillin with his dope wings all veiled and lit like insta-sunrise, he flew through heaven’s midst; the angel crews parted left and right to clear his speed on that empyreal road until at heaven’s gate the door auto-flipped wide on golden hinges, spun by the divine mastermind’s work of epic design  

from here, no cloud or star—not even the tiniest star—wanted to block his epic sight, all shinin’ in sync with other flexin’ globes: earth and god’s garden crowned with cedars above all hills, like when in the night galileo’s glass (all shaky and less assured) spies at imagined lands on the moon, or a pilot from the cyclades peeps a cloudy spot over delos or samos, and he yeets down, flyin through that vast ethereal sky between worlds and worlds with steady wing—first ridin polar winds then with a quick fan beat winnows the buxom air, until among towering eagles he seems like a phoenix, the one sole bird that all gaze at, when to enshrine his relics in the sun’s bright temple he jets off to egyptian thebes, straight up legendary  

instantly on the eastern cliff of paradise he lights up and returns to his seraph form—six wings he rocked to shade his divine drip, with a pair cladin each broad shoulder that mantled over his chest in regal ornament, the middle pair girdin his waist like a starry zone and skirttin his loins and thighs with downy gold and heaven-dipped colors, while the third set shadowed his feet from each heel with feathered mail in sky-tinctured grain, standin like maia’s son, shakin his plumes so that heavenly fragrance floods the wide circuit; every angel band on watch straight-up knew him and rose in honor to his high message, cuz on some next-level memo they guessed he was totally bound for greatness  

he slid past glittering tents and now is here in the blissful field, cruisin through groves of myrrh and flowery odours—cassia, nard, and balm—in a wilderness of sweets where nature is wildin’ like in her prime, playin at will with virgin fancies pourin out more extra-sweet vibes, wild and enormous bliss way above any rule or art  
 
through that spicy forest, adam peeped him comin as he sat in his cool bower, while the mounted sun dropped direct fervid rays to warm earth’s innermost crib, way more heat than adam even needs, and eve inside, on her schedule, prepped for a dinner of savoury fruits to please that true appetite without any of the disrelish thirst for nectar sips from a milky stream or berry or grape, so adam hollered her—  

“hurry hither, eve, come peep east among those trees, check out that glorious shape movin this way; seems like another morn risen on mid-noon, like some epic behest drop from heaven, maybe bringin our guest vibes today—so bounce with speed and bring all the stash u got, pour out that abundance fit to honor and welcome our heavenly stranger; we got the funds to drop our own gifts and bestow large from nature’s excess, where fertile growth multiplies and explodes in bounty, boss-level instructin us not to spare a thing.”  

to whom eve goes, “adam, god-inspired mold of the earth, our small store gonna do—where every season’s ripe hangin on the stalk, save that which frugal store-up gains to nourish and what extra moistness consumes on the side—but i’ma rush and from every bough and brake, each plant and juiciest gourd, pluck that prime choice to entertain our angel-guest, so when he peeps it he’ll confess that here on earth god dropped his bounties just like in heaven, straight flex.”  

so sayin, with dispatch looks and mad hurry, she spins on hospitable thoughts, pickin out the delicacy best, choosin the order so it don’t mix tastes that ain’t well teamed—inelegant slop—rather bringin taste after taste with the kindest change; she bestirs herself then, and from every tender stalk, whatever earth, that all-bearin’ mama yields—whether in india east or west or the mid shore, in pontus or on the punick coast, or where alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds in rough coat, smooth rind, bearded husk, or even shell, she gathers that large tribute and heaps it unsparingly on the board; for drink, she crushes that grape into inoffensive must and meaths from plenty a berry and sweet kernels pressed into dulcet creams, and nah, she ain’t about to hold back, deadass. 

wants her lit vessels pure deadass; then yeets the ground with mad rose vibes and dank odours from the shrub unlit, fr fr

meanwhile our primitive big bro, our original sire, be cruisin to meet his god-tier guest, rollin out flexin with nothin but his full-on savage self-perfection, all in him like a gigachad drip, way more solemn than those boring pomp vibes waitin on npc princes when their squad of iced-out horses and gold-splattered grooms roll up, dazzlin the crowd and leavin ‘em all caught in 4k, legit agape

closer to his epic aura, adam, not totally shook but lowkey bowin like a sus homie, steps up all meek and respectful to that next-level nature and goes, "yo native of heaven, no spot on this earth can match the epic glow of heaven cuz you dipped down from the throne and blessed us for a sec to peep and honor just us two, holdin this spacious turf in that chill shady bower, where we can kick it and munch on the garden’s prime picks ‘til the mid-day heat dips and the sun cools off" 

then angelic virtue, all smooth and mild, fired back, "adam, i came too; you weren’t built or parked here for random invites even if the heavenly squad rolls through, so lead on to your bower that’s over the top for these chill mid-hour vibes ‘til evening hits, i got free reign" – so they bounced to that sylvan crib that popped off like pomona’s arbour on fleek, decked out with flower drip and bomb scents; meanwhile, eve, rockin nothing but her raw self, looked more snatched than any wood-nymph or the flyest goddess flex from mount ida, standin there to vibe with her heavenly guest with zero need for a veil ‘cause her virtue was on lock, no weak sauce messin with her cheek – and on her the angel dropped a hail that later turned into that holy greet for bless mary, aka second eve

hail, mother of mankind, queen of that fruitful drip, whose womb be overloadin the world with your sons more than god’s trees could ever pile up their various fruity blessings on a grassy table with mossy seats all around and an ample square flooded with autumn vibes even when spring and autumn be dancin hand in hand like a glitchy meme collab; they kicked off a little chat – no cap, not worried ‘bout dinner gettin cold – and then our author chimed in, "yo heavenly stranger, come get these bomb bounties that our ultimate nourisher, the source of all perfect drip, showers down on us for munchies and pure delight, makin this earth drop mad yield; even if this grub might be sus for spirit npcs, i know one thing: one celestial dad hooks up everyone with the real ultimate feed" 

so then the angel goes, "yo, what i dished out (praise always on loop) to man in that half-spirit mode brings you only the purest spirit fuel – no dank ingrate chow – and both that and your brainy, straight-up intellectual fuel got all the base senses inside, like audio, visual, sniff, tap, taste, then mix, digest, assimilate, and flip from all corporeal vibes into that ghostly, incorporeal zone" 

‘cause listen up, whatever got created needs constant fuel and sustainment – the gross feeds the pure, like earth feeds the sea, and both pump up the air, which in turn fuels them ethereal fires, and on the low the moon is the first chill, its round vibe still rockin unpurged vapours that haven’t even hit her substance yet, deadass

and the moon ain’t droppin any nourishment vibes from her moist continent to those higher orbs, while the sun, dishing light to all, collects its feed from humid exhalations and then sits down to sup with the ocean – even though up in heaven the trees of life drop ambrosial fruit and the vines spill that sweet nectar, even when each morn we swipe off mellifluous dews and peep the ground all covered with pearly grain, god here switched up his bounty game with fresh delights that can flex with heaven itself; and yo, don’t think i’m gonna be all prim ‘n proper when i serve this taste – so they sat low and dove into their viands, and neither the angel nor that typical theologian mist gloss was on, but he came with that real hunger and scorching heat to transubstantiate stuff through pure spirit ease – like, if some sooty coal alchemist can glitch the drossiest ore into perfect gold from the mine, meanwhile at the table eve was dishing naked vibes, with their cups flowin and crowned in lit liquors: o innocence deservin paradise, if ever – then the sons of god had legit excuse to get totally enamored at that sight, but in those hearts love was kept unlibidinous and zero jealousy reigned, no injured lover’s hell here

so once they chowed down on those meats and drinks, not weighin nature down, a sudden brainwave hit adam – not lettin this sick chance slip by, gifted by that epic confab to peep the deets of what’s above his world and the beings chillin in heaven whose excellence outshined his own by hella miles, their radiant forms and divine glow and raw high power straight up exceeded all human levels; and with that cautious drip he dropped his speech straight to the empyreal minister

"oh inhabitant with god, check it – i know your favor in this honor dished out to man; under your humble crib you’ve allowed us in and let us taste these earthly fruits – not exactly angel gourmet but still accepted as if you couldn’t even roll up to heaven’s high feasts any more willingly – but yo, what even is that compared to..." the winged hierarch then clapped back

"yo adam, one almighty boss is the source from which everything pops off and to which all returns, if they ain’t gone off-roading from good; created all as flawless, one prime matter all in one, loaded with diff forms and degrees of substance, and for things that live, bomb life vibes; but the closer you get, the more refined, spirited-up and pure you become, as if placed nearer to that boss or trending in his flex – each in their own active sphere until the body and spirit vibe in perfect bounds, scaled to each type – so from the root springs a lighter green stalk, then from that the leaves get all aery, and finally the bright, full-on consummate flower breathes out scented spirit vibes; flowers and their fruit, man’s chow, slowly sublimed to vibe with the vital spirits, the animal, the intellectual – givin’ both life and sense, flair and deep understanding – whence the soul gets its reason and becomes reason itself, discursive or intuitive; discourse is mostly your jam, and intuition is ours, differin only in degree but vibin on the same wavelength" 

so don’t be wonderin what god saw as good for you if i don’t flip it but convert it just like you to proper substance – time might drop when humans roll with angels, choppin’ it up with a diet that ain’t inconvenient or too light, and from these corporal munchies your bodies might finally glitch into full spirit mode, leveled up by time and with wings to ascend ethereal like us; or you might choose to crash either here or in heavenly paradises if you stay obedient and locked in his full-on love, ‘cause y’all are his progeny – meanwhile, vibe and enjoy all the happiness this dope state can drop, ‘cause it can’t get any more

then the patriarch of mankind fired back, "yo favourable spirit, dope guest, you schooled us on the route to level up our knowledge and set the scale of nature from center to edge; by starin’ deep into created things, we step our way up to god – but tell me, what did that caution mean if you’re found obedient? can we even ask for obedience from him, or ditch his love, who molded us from dust and parked us here to the max measure of bliss that human desires can chase or even snag?" 

and the angel shot, "son of heaven and earth, listen up! your happy vibes are owed to god, but your keepin’ on that vibe is all on you – your obedience is the real deal; this here is that caution, so take note – god made you perfect, but not locked in stone; he dropped you as good but left it in your power to hustle on, givin’ you free will not chained by fate or strict necessity; our voluntary service is the only ticket, not forced – ‘cause how can hearts that ain’t free be tested on whether they serve willingly when destiny just makes 'em do what they must with zero choice?" the angel continues, "me and the whole angelic host chillin in god’s sight, enthroned and livin in that dope happy state, hold our vibe while your obedience holds – there’s no other guarantee: we serve free AF because we love free, ‘cause in our will we can choose to love or not; in this we rise or fall – some have fallen, trippin’ into disobedience and droppin’ from heaven to the deepest hell, o fall from such high bliss into mega woe!" 

and then our great progenitor replied, "yo, your words hit different – i was all ears like when cherubic jams dropped by night from the nearby hills, those aereal beats coming through; i knew we were crafted free as both will and deed, yet we vowed never to forget to love our maker and obey his single, just command – that truth been my constant vibe, assured then and still assured now; even though what you spill went down in heaven and stirred a lil doubt in me, i’m craving the full tea if you’re down to drop it, the complete wild relation so strange it’s worthy of sacred silence to be heard – and we got plenty of day left, ‘cause the sun has barely wrapped half its journey and just started its other half in the vast zone of heaven" 

so adam popped the request, and raphael, after a chill pause, assented and kicked things off, "yo, high matter you just enjoined me, prime of men – it’s a sad and hard-ass task: how do i even spill the invisible exploits of those warring spirit warriors to your human sense? how to drop the tea on the ruin of so many once-glorious, perfect vibes without goin off with zero remorse? how do i unfold the secrets of another world that might even be illegal to reveal? but for your own gain, here’s the dispensed deets; and whatever goes beyond what human sense can peep, i’ll break it down by comparin’ spiritual shit to corporal forms, expressin’ it in the dankest way – even if earth is just a lowkey shadow of heaven and every thing in it vibes together way more than what we peep on earth, yo?"

as yet this world was not, and chaos wild af like total glitch-mode void energy, deadass spilling chaotic vibes everywhere, yo  
reigned where these heavens now roll, where earth now rests flexin’ like a chill cosmic npc on her center stage, legit yeeted into the void lol  
upon her center poised; when on a day (for time, though in eternity, applied to motion, measures all things durable by present, past, and future,) on such day the universe went full skibidi bop, no cap, as if insta-timed by a cosmic clock on remix mode  
as heaven’s great year beamed up the empyreal host of angels by imperial summons called, squad goals on fleek, straight-up summoned like a tiktok flash mob, fr fr  
innumerable before the almighty’s throne, like a million dank memes stacked up, caught in 4k and flexin’ with that big yikes energy  
forthwith, from all the ends of heaven, they popped off like surprise fire drops, under their hierarchs in orders bright: pure yeet squad assemble, lit beyond belief  
ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced, standards and gonfalons ’twixt van and rear stream in the air, drippin’ in cosmic drip on full turbo mode, all for that extra flex in hierarchies, orders, and degrees  
or in their glittery tissues, rockin’ imblazed holy memorials, acts of zeal and love recorded like viral TikTok clout, epic and unfiltered, deadass  
thus when in orbs of circuit inexpressible they stood, orb within orb, the father infinite, that ultimate sigma, by whom in bliss imbosomed sat the son, chillin’ like a gigachad on a flaming mount whose top brightness went full invisibility mode, yo so then it spake:  
hear, all ye angels, progeny of light, thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers; listen up, squad, my decree is posted for life, unrevoked like your fave meme trend  
this day i have begot whom i declare my only son, anointed on this sacred hill like a legendary influencer at peak drip, and who ye now behold at my right hand; your top is set on him, no cap, and by my own swear, all knees in heaven gonna bend like glitchy servo motors and confess him lord, flexin’ mad vibes  
under his great vice-gerent reign, united as one soulful crew, forever happy AF: him who disobeys, me disobeys, breaks the squad bond and that day gets yeeted out from god and that blessed vision, falling into utter darkness, deep ingulfed and forever locked out, no redeem button, total ban—big yikes  
so spake the omnipotent, and with his words everyone seemed hella hyped; all looked chill, but yo, not all was as it seemed, glitch warning activated  
that day, like every other solemn day, they vibed in song and dance around the sacred hill; a mystical rave lit like a cosmic festival, deadass  
mystical dance, where yonder starry sphere of planets and of fixed wheels spun intricate mazes, eccentric AF, intervolved yet oddly regular in that chaos—total cosmic remix, skibidi style  
and in their moves, divine harmony smoothed out their charming tones so that god’s own ear, tuned like a hype playlist, listened all delighted like a viral bop  
evening now approached (for we got our own evening and our morn, swapping deets like a change-up on the dope grind, not needin’ extra flex)  
forthwith from dance to a sweet repast they flipped, desirous as heck; all in circles like a roundtable chat, tables set up like a dank buffet suddenly piled with angels food, and rubied nectar flows in pearls, in diamonds, and massy gold, fruit from the most delish vines—heaven’s own all-you-can-eat, legit  
on flowers reposed, crowned with fresh petals like Snapchat filters on nature, they ate, they drank, and in that communion, quaffed immortality and joy like sippin’ liquid clout, secure in a feast where only excess be the limit before the all-bounteous king, who showered blessings like a celeb dropping merch, rejoicing in their epic vibe  
now when ambrosial night with cloudy exhale slid off that high mount of god—where light and shade pop off in a constant remix—the face of brightest heaven switched up to grateful twilight (for night there ain’t donning no dark veil) and roseate dews arranged everything except the unsleeping eyes of god, who never taps out; the view stretched wide over the plain, wider than this whole globous earth spread out like a massive meme canvas (such are the courts of god), as the angelic throng dispersed in bands and files, their camp riding on living streams among the trees of life, with countless pavilions suddenly sprung up like pop-up discord servers, celestial tabernacles chillin’ with cool crosswinds; save those who, on their course, dropped melodious hymns around the sovran throne all night long on loop—but not so for satan; call him that now, for his old name got canceled in heaven, he who was once the arch-angel, the OG of powers, a top-tier influencer in favor and pre-eminence until envy hit him hard over god’s son—when the day came that the father went all legendary and crowned him messiah king anointed, satan just couldn’t handle the drip and got triggered by pride, thinking himself impaired, mega rage mode, no chill  
deep malice brewed and disdain bubbled up, and as midnight rolled in—the dusk hour best for sleep and silence—he resolved with his entire legion to dislodge and leave the supreme throne totally unworshipped and unobeyed, mad disrespect; then his next subordinate, just waking up, slid in secret DM-style and whispered:  
“sleepest thou, companion dear? what sleep can close thy eyelids? remember the decree from yesterday, that ancient drop from heaven’s almighty lips? thou used to share thy thoughts with me like old squad convos; we were lit together—so how now can your sleep dissent? new laws are droppin’, new rules from him who reigns, and new minds among us who serve, new counsels to debate what wild chaos might ensue—yo, better not spill too much here though. assemble all my myriads, the chief squad; tell them that by command, before dim night’s shadow bounces away, i gotta speed up, and all who wave their banners under me, get flyin’ home to the north quarters, where we secure the spot, our sanctuary, our sacred hill, and prep the hype to welcome our king, the great messiah, and his fresh commands—who’s about to glide through all these hierarchies triumphant and drop new laws, fr fr.”  
so spake the false arch-angel, infusing bad vibes into the unwary heart of his mate—he rallied, one by one or in clusters, the regent powers under him regent; spittin’ what he was taught, dishing that the most high, pre-night, before dim night even cleared the heavens, had set the great hierarchal standard to move—dropping ambiguous, sus words and jealous tea to twist integrity, but still, everyone peaced out to the usual signal and the potent voice of their boss; his name was high-key legendary up there, his degree in heaven massive, his countenance shining like the morning-star that steered the starry flock, luring a third of heaven’s host with sleek lies and cosmic clout, legit squad follow  
meanwhile the eternal eye, scoping out the most abstruse thoughts from his holy mount and from inside the golden lamps burnin’ nightly like viral fire before him, peeped rebellion rising in the dark; saw how amongst the sons of morn, multitudes were banded up to oppose his high decree; and smirkin’, he told his only son, “son, in you i see my full resplendent glory, the heir of all my might—yo, it’s time we double-check our omnipotence and see what arms we gotta flex to hold onto what we’ve always claimed, be it deity or empire: a foe is risin’, tryna set up his own throne equal to ours across the spacious north; and he ain’t just chill—he wants a battle to test our power and our right to rule. let’s strategize, pull the force we got left, and use every trick in our defense, or else we might lose this high place, our sanctuary, our hill, deadass.”  
to which the son, chill as a lightning divine, ineffable and serene like a cool breeze over a neon rave, answered, “mighty father, you who roast your foes with epic derision, laughing at their lame antics, count on my glory when their hate throws shade—watch as i flex regal power to squash their pride and then we’ll see if i’m dexterous enough to subdue your rebels or if i end up the worst in heaven.”  
so spake the son; but satan, with his crew of powers, was zooming on winged speed, a host countless as the night’s stars or morning dew-drops that the sun pearls on every leaf and flower, dripping nature’s own bling, full cap  
regions they cruised through—the mighty regencies of seraphim, potentates, and thrones in triple degrees; realms where your dominion, adam, is nothing more than what this garden is to the earth and sea, like a mini drop compared to a whole globose flex stretched in longitude; and after vibin’ through those zones, they finally hit up the north’s limits, where satan landed on his royal seat high on a hill, blazing like a mount on fire, stacked with pyramids and towers carved from diamond quarries and gold rocks—welcome to the palace of great lucifer (as the homies call it in human chatter), which not long after, he tried to mimic god’s equality, lowkey imitating that mount where messiah got declared in full view of heaven—the mountain of the congregation, so called; and for that, he gathered his entire train, pretendin’ he was commanded to huddle up about the grand welcome for their king, droppin’ counterfeit truths and artful calumnies to hold their ears in a sketchy meet-up, total fake tea, no cap  
thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers; if these flashy titles still matter beyond just labels, since by decree another has now grabbed all power, and we got eclipsed under the name of king anointed—for whom all this midnight-march hustle and rushed meetup was just to consult on how best to, with new honours and ideas, receive him comin’ to collect that knee-tribute still unpaid, that vile prostration! too much for one fam, but imagine double that on one, and then mirroring his image? but what if smarter counsels could spark our minds and teach us to drop this old yoke? will ye submit and bend those supple necks and knees? nah, if i’m tryna know you right, or if you know you’re the original natives and sons of heaven, unmatched by any, and if not completely equal then at least free—equally free, cuz orders and degrees don’t mess with liberty, they just vibe with it! who in their right mind can assume monarchy over peers if they’re already equal in freedom and drip? or drop laws on us, who err not, just to claim we’re meant to govern, not serve—mad sus energy, fr fr  
thus far his bold, no-control discourse had the audience hyped; then among the seraphim, abdiel—who no one adored with more crazy zeal for the deity and divine commands obeyed, straight fire vibes—  
the deity, and divine commands obeyed, pure yeet energy, legit cosmic lit forever, rn peace out chaos!

stood up, yo, and like, in a mega lit flame of extra zeal no cap, the current of his mad fury was like totally opposing all that weak energy, deadass  
yo, argument be all blasphemous, bogus, and hella proud fam, words that no chill soul in heaven ever even dared to peep, like least of all from you, ingr8—you straight up flexin’ yourself way above your squad, smh

canst thou, with your impious shade-throwin’ drip, come at god’s legit decree, all pronounced and sworn, that his one and only son—royally endued with a dope scepter—gets every soul in heaven to yeet down and bow, straight up confessin’ him as the rightful king? yo, that’s flat-out unjust, bro, you sayin’ it’s mad unjust to chain the free with lame laws and let one one-king rule over all the homies with unsucceded, mega boss power, no cap

so you tryna drop laws on god? you gonna dispute with him on liberty points, the dude who made you what you are and built up the whole heavenly squad exactly how he vibed, circumscribed their whole being and whatnot?  
 
but based on mad life experience we know he’s hella providential for our good vibes and dignity, like he never even thought of makin’ us less but straight up pumped us to be extra, united under one head closer than your group chat—yet to grant you that equal over all flex is totally bogus, like you think you’re that epic? even all angelic nature in one snap can’t match that begotten son, by whom the mighty father, with his word drop, made every lil’ thing—even you—and all the spirits in heaven, cranking them up in their bright degrees, crowning ‘em with glory, naming them thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers, essential power-ups; not obscured by his reign but boosted mega high ‘cause he’s the head homie of our crew, making his laws ours and all the clout bouncing back to him, for real

so chill with your extra impious rage now, and don’t even tempt these vibes; just hustle to appease the heated father and his fired-up son, while you can still snag a pardon if you slide in on time

so spake the fervent angel, dropping his hot takes, but his insane zeal got zero seconding—like outta season and hella rash, which had the apostate hyped and, even more extra, droppin’ his savage reply

yo, you say we were formed then? that we’re the work of some secondary hands, like a task passed from the father to his son? that’s a strange, fresh meme right there! and this doctrine, which we’re tryna peep from where it came—who even saw this creation pop off? you remember your own making when the maker straight up gave you being, fr fr?

we know literally no time when we weren’t vibin’ like we do now; there was never a prequel when we weren’t self-begotten, self-raised by our own quickening power, even when that fatal course had circled his full orb and the epic, mature birth of our native heaven and our ethereal sons dropped, deadass

our own flex is 100% ours now; our right-hand hustle be schoolin’ us on the dopest deeds just to test who’s on our level—then you’ll peep whether we’re coming at the almighty throne with humble supplication or full-on siege mode. yo, take this report and yeet these tidings straight to the anointed king, and bounce before any evil catches your flight in 4k

he dropped that news; and like, the deep sound of water and hoarse murmurs echoed mad applause through an infinite squad, and even then, the flaming seraph—fearless as heck, even when solo and totally encircled by haters—clapped back with bold, savage energy

yo, alien from god, o spirit accursed, totally forsaken of all good vibes! i peep your epic fall as already locked in, and your hapless crew’s down with this shady scam, a contagion spread with both your crimes and punishments, so from now on, don’t stress on how to ditch god’s messiah—those chill indulgent laws won’t be regranted, and new decrees against you are coming unsentimental, no recall; that golden scepter you yeeted is now an iron rod ready to smash and break your disobedience hard, bruh. you did drop some advice, but not for your threats—i ain’t bouncin’ from these wicked tents, ‘cause unless you wanna feel wrath, raging like sudden flames that don’t even let you tell things apart, you better brace to catch his thunder smackin’ your head with devouring fire, straight up

then who even created you, huh, while you’re out here lamentin’? and who can uncreate you, my dude? so then spake the seraph abdiel, the only one who stayed real among the fake, the one faithful soul found among a sea of npc fakes—unmoved, unshaken, unseduced, unterrified, keepin’ his loyalty, love, and zeal locked down; no squad number or peer pressure could make him swerve from truth or flip his constant mind, even when standin’ solo. he peaced out from them, trekking mad through hostile shade which he sustained like a true gigachad, without fear of any violence, and with retorted, savage scorn, he turned his back on those proud towers destined for swift destruction, yeet

book vi

all night long the dreadless angel, unbothered and totally untargeted, cruised through heaven’s wide champain like a boss until morn woke up thanks to the circlin’ hours, with a rosy swipe flingin’ open the gates of light—no joke. there’s this rad cave in god’s mountain, chillin’ right by his throne, where light and darkness are in a never-ending dance, switching up their vibes on a constant loop that makes heaven a wild rollercoaster—like day and night on repeat, deadass. light blasts out, and at the flip side, that extra obedient darkness creeps in until her time comes to cover up heaven, even if it just seems like a dab of twilight here, lol. then, boom, morn slid out lookin’ all extra, decked in gold like the top-tier in heaven, empyreal and flexin’, blasting orient beams through the ghost of vanished night; meanwhile, the whole plain got covered in thick, embattled, bright squadrons—chariots, flaming arms, and fiery steeds drivin’ blaze on blaze—that first caught his eye: war, straight up war in full prep mode, and he peeped that tea he thought he’d spill as news already. gladly, he vibed and mixed it up with those friendly powers who welcomed him with mad joy and loud hype, ‘cause among so many fallen myriads, one did not go lost

then they yeeted him up to the sacred hill, mad applauded, and dropped him right in front of the supreme seat; from within a golden cloud a mellow voice came through, like, “servant of god, well done; you fought the better fight, holdin’ it down solo against a revolted mob for truth, your words hitting way harder than their lame arms, and you carried that universal roast that’s way tougher than violence—your whole mission was to stand approved in god’s sight, even though the worlds peeped you as perverse. now the easier win is on deck for you, backed by this host of squad homies, to yeet back your foes in way more glorious fashion than how you dipped out, and to subdue by force those who ghosted reason for their laws, right reason for their law, and for their king, messiah, who reigns by legit merit, no cap”

yo, michael, my celestial armies’ prince, and you too, gabriel, flexin’ with next-level military prowess, lead the charge to battle these invincible sons of mine; round up my armed saints by the thousands, even millions, all set to throw down, matching the gang of godless rebels in numbers, deadass; hit ‘em with fire and hostile arms in a fearless assault, and chase that drill to the very brow of heaven, drivin’ them out from god and his bliss, and yeeting ‘em into their punishment zone—the deep gulf of tartarus, which wide-opened his fiery chaos, ready to catch their epic fall, legit

so then the sovran voice dropped that order, and immediately the clouds started darkenin’ the whole hill, smoke rollin’ in dusky wreaths and reluctant flames—a full-on sign of wrath waking up; and as if that weren’t enough, the loud ethereal trumpet from way up high blared, no chill, and at that command the militant powers reppin’ heaven joined up in a mega tight quadrate union that was literally irresistible, movin’ in silence with their bright legions synced to an instrumental harmony that breathed heroick ardor into wild, adventurous deeds under their god-like leaders, all in the cause of god and his messiah. they kept on movin’, indissoluble and firm; no obvious hill, no tight vale, no wood or stream could split their perfect ranks, ‘cause high above the ground their march was lit, with even the chill air carrying their nimble steps—like when all the birds lined up in orderly array over eden to get their names called out, so over many tracts of heaven they marched, across provinces ten times longer than this terrene, deadass. at last, far off on the northern horizon, a fiery region stretched from skirt to skirt in a battailous flex, and on closer zoom, it was bristlin’ with countless upright beams, rigid spears, a throng of helmets and shields, all boasting extra hype—these were the banded powers of satan, rushin’ on with furious expedition, ‘cause they were thinkin’ that on the very same day, by fight or surprise, they’d snatch god’s mount and set up shop on his throne to crown the envious aspirer of his state, the proud one; but spoiler, their vibin’ thoughts turned out soft and vain mid-game—like, it was super strange at first that an angel would go to war with another angel, meet up in fierce hosting, when they’re usually chillin’ in festivals of joy and love, all unanimous like sons of one big sire hyping the eternal father—but then the battle shouts dropped, and the rushing sounds of the enemy smashed every mellow thought in a flash

high in the midst, flexin’ like a god, the apostate sat in his sun-bright chariot, an idol of divine majesty, all enclosed by flaming cherubim and golden shields, pure extra vibes; then suddenly light burst from his gorgeous throne, ‘cause now between host and host there was only a narrow gap—a dreadful interval, face-to-face, presenting in a terrifying array of hideous length. right before the cloudy van, on the rough edge of battle before the squads merged, satan himself stormed up with vast and haughty strides, towering and armed in mad adamant and gold, like an ultimate boss stepping in; abdiel could not even stand that sight, where he was among the mightiest, all bent on the highest deeds, and his undaunted heart went into full exploration mode. oh heaven, how can it be that any resemblance of the highest still hangs around when true faith and realness are straight ghosted—why should strength and might not show up when virtue is ghostin’, or the weakest even test the boldest when facin’ the unconquerable? his own flex, trusting in the almighty’s aid, i mean to test out all that unsound bogus reason, and it’s only just that he, who won debates on truth, should also win in arms in both verbal and straight-up contests—even if that clash was brutish and foul when reason had to tango with raw force, deadass so


yo, most reason got yeeted by reason itself, deadass overpowered, no cap, smh  
so ponderin’ and from his squad of decked-out armed homies, flexin’ on all n00bs  
then he yeeted out oppositely, half-walkin’ and clapped a daredevil foe, wild energy fr  
his sussy nemesis, stuntin’ extra hard to block his drip and prevention mode activated, big yikes  
mad lit as f, so he clapped him with secure, savage defiance—straight salty, deadass  
proud, yo, u met? ur hope was tryna hit that max clout high-tier vibe, unopposed flex, no npc energy  
the ultimate peak of ur aspiring drip, unopposed, deadass highkey  
u was chasin’ that god-tier throne, left wide open like a glitch, with his side ghosted af  
abandoned, left in full terror from ur savage power—ka boom, mega yikes energy  
or that potent flossed tongue, fool! get real, so vain it’s cringe, big yikes, no cap  
tryna throw arms at the omnipotent? that’s like flexin’ against infinity, pure cringe, deadass  
the omnipotent, who outta tiniest tea could yeet endless armies nonstop to mukbang ur folly, wild  
had raised endless squads nonstop to cancel ur epic clownery, constant drip claps, fr  
or with one lone, gigachad hand, full solo gamer mode, lit and savage  
reachin’ beyond all chill limits with one mega yeet blow, instantaneous sus takedown  
unaided, could’ve finished u off, dunked ur whole crew into a dark void, pure whelm, smh  
ur legions got drowned under dark vibes—but yo, check it, not everyone’s ridin’ with u, fam  
not all in ur ride; some squad members hold mad faith and piety for god, even if u don’t peep ‘em  
they’re invisible to u while i was the lone glow in ur world, dissentin’ all the bogus norms, deadass  
i was the lone real one, defyin’ all the faux, and my gang u see—lesson dropped way too late  
so few get it sometimes while thousands be errin’, caught in 4k, sus af  
whom the grand foe, throwin’ salty, scornful side-eye, dissin’ all the cringe, answered like,  
“yo, ill for ya but in my revenge hour u came back from your fly mode, seditious angel, bruh”  
from flight, that seditious angel, u returned to snatch your merited reward, check it  
ur doped reward, the first trial of this right hand, provoked ever since that tongue got lit with contradiction sauce and dared to opp a third of the god squad in that synod, meme central  
those gods, all flexin’ divine energy, felt that vigor but let no omnipotence slide, deadass  
but u rolled up before ur boys, hyped to snatch some plumage from me so u could flex destruction on the rest, big clout  
this pause (unanswered so u don’t brag) let u know, “at first i thought liberty and heaven were one epic vibe for heavenly souls; but now i peep most in lazy slump chose to serve ministring spirits, trained up in feast and bop mode, no cap”  
yo, u armed the heavenly minstrels with servility mixed with free flex, ready to contest and throw down epic moves that this very day will prove it  
to which abdiel, all stern and extra, clapped back:  
“apostate! still u’re off track, endless errors, errin’ so far from the straight truth lane, mad remote, no chill  
unjustly u twist truth with the name of servitude, callin’ it to serve whoever god or nature drops the order—both drop the same command for the dopest ruler, the ultimate gigachad—  
so serving the clueless or rebels like u, u ain’t free, u’re self-enslaved, clingin’ to ur own hype, lewdly clownin’ our ministring squad, big yikes”  
reign in hell, u can rule that crummy kingdom; let me flex in heaven, ever-blessed by god, followin’ his divine behests, worth obeyin’, no cap  
but in hell, expect chains only—not a whole realm—meanwhile, as u said, comin’ back from your fly mode, take this greet on your impious crest, clout check, yo  
so sayin’, he hoisted that noble stroke high af, then it didn’t hang but fell swift like a tempest, a full-on yeet drop  
it slammed down on satan’s proud crest so intensely that no eyes or swift thought could even glitch his shield, deadass  
and any rapid thought couldn’t intercept that glitch shield, straight ruin, big yikes, as he recoiled ten massive paces—  
on the tenth, gettin’ on bended knee, his chunky spear stood up like it was planted on earth where winds and waters lowkey push mountains sideways, half sunken and all his pines wrecked, wild af  
and the rebel thrones got shook, their mightiest clapped, which lit our joy and got us shoutin’ presage of victory and fierce battle desire, full-on fire, no cap  
at that moment, michael banged the arch-angel trumpet so loud that throughout vast heaven hosanna rang to the highest, epic vibes  
meanwhile the adverse legions, shook and defeated, didn’t even hold their gaze—they just joined in the horrid shock, table-flipped style  
then a stormin’ fury and a clamour never heard before erupted—arms clashing on armour, brayin’ like a glitchy remix, and the maddening wheels of brazen chariots raged in skibidi chaos, dire noise pure mayhem  
overhead, dismal hiss from fiery darts in flaming volleys flew, vaulting every host with scorching fire, insane AF  
so under a fiery cope, both main battles rushed together in ruinous, mosh-pit style assault with inextinguishable rage—  
all heaven resounded, and if earth had been around, whole earth would’ve shook its center, fr  
what wonder when millions of fierce angels clashed, even the least wielding elemental memes, armed with full force from all their regions, viral energy off the charts  
imagine armies on armies, countless squads raised in dreadful combustion to rage, disturbin’ but not destroyin’ their happy native crib, all while the eternal king, omnipotent boss of heaven, kept their might in check  
even though each divided legion looked like a vast viral host and each armed hand was its own legion, every warrior felt like the solo chief, expert in advance, stand, or flip the grim battle script with epic timing—  
no thoughts of flight or retreat, every fighter solely relying on his arm for that moment of snapping victory, legendary deeds of eternal fame done infinite as the war spread wide like endless streams, viral and never-ending  
the battle hung long, sometimes a standin’ fight on firm ground then rocketing on main wing, tormenting all the air with raging fire vibes  
all air seemed to be in full conflict mode, like a long, even-scale fire war that hung until satan, who that day dropped prodigious power and met in arms with no equal, battled through the dire attack of confused fighting seraphim, finally peepin’ where michael’s sword smote hard and felled squadrons in one massive domino yeet  
with a huge two-handed swing, brandishing that horrid edge aloft, it came down wide-wasting everything—so savage that to withstand such destruction, he hastened and clapped back against the rocky orb of tenfold adamant, his ample shield a vast, unyielding circumference  
at his approach, the great arch-angel from his warlike hustle straight up conked out, glad as if hopin’ to end that inner war in heaven, while the arch-foe got subdued, dragged in chains with a hostile frown and flame-lit visage—then it all kicked off, chaos mode activated  
author of evil, once unknown till ur revolt, now un-named in heaven but as bombed as u see these hateful strife acts, hateful to all and measured hard on u and ur crew—how did u disturb heaven’s blessed peace and bring misery into nature that wasn’t even on the radar till ur rebel crime, instillin’ malice into thousands of once upright, faithful souls now proven false!  
but don’t even think of messin’ with holy rest; heaven yeets u from all her confines, ‘cause heaven, seat of bliss, brooks no violence or war vibes, so bye bye  
hence then, evil takes u along with ur offspring to that place of ultimate evil, hell; u and ur wicked crew, get out, yeet  
where broils mingle and brawls spark before the avenging sword starts servin’ u doom or some sudden divine vengeance winged from god that precipitates u with next-level augmented pain, straight savage, no cap  
so spake the prince of angels; and then the adversary clapped back, “yo, don’t think airy threats can scare someone who ain’t droppin’ real deeds—u can’t, for real. hast thou turned even the least of these to flight, or if they fall, they rise unvanquished? don’t get it twisted, imperious threat-chasin’ won’t make u chase me off, err not, ‘cause that’ll just end the strife u call evil—we call it the strife of glory, which we mean to win or even flip heaven into the hell u fablest”  
thou fablest; here, though, we dwell free if not to reign; meanwhile, muster ur utmost force and join that dude almighty to aid u, cause i ain’t bouncin’ but have sought thee far and nigh, no cap  
they ended parle and both addressed an unspeakable fight, raw combat vibes so intense that even an angel’s tongue can’t relate to the earth-shattering boost of godlike power  
for real, who on earth can lift human imagination to such a high level of godlike drip? they looked like literal gods, standin’ and movin’ with epic stature, motion, and arms fit to decide the empire of great heaven—ultimate chad mode  
now they waved their fiery swords, makin’ horrid circles in the air; two broad suns on their shields blazed in opposite directions while expectation stood all shook, then each hand swiftly retreated from where the thickest fight was, leavin’ huge, unsafe fields in the wild wind of chaos  
such commotion, like watchin’ great things erupt from tiny seeds when nature’s vibe breaks, among constellations war was spawned—two planets rushin’ with malign aspect, mid-sky battlin’ and clashin’ jarring spheres in a cosmic brawl, kek  
together both, next to almighty arms up-lifted, they aimed one imminent stroke that might seal the deal, power on full blast, no repeat needed, ‘cause no opposing force could even get odds or swift preventions, no cap  
but michael’s sword from god’s armory was so tempered that neither keen edge nor solid force could resist its epic cut—it met satan’s sword with steep force, descendin’ and half-cutting his sheer form; then, with a swift wheel reverse, it deep-entered and split all his right side, mad savage, fr  
then satan first felt deep pain, writhed to and fro, convulsin’ in a glitchy meltdown, as that griding sword left discontinuous wounds; but his ethereal vibe clapped up fast, not long divisible, and from that gash a stream of necturous humour started issuin’, pure sanguine celestial drip spillin’ over his stained armour that once shined bright, now dark and tragic, no cap  
forthwith, angels many and strong ran in, blockin’ and interposing defense while others hoisted him on their shields back to his chariot chillaxed away from the war files, safe mode on  
from the war zone, they laid him down, gnashin’ in anguish and spite as his unmatched pride got clapped, humbled so hard that his confidence to equal god in power was totally busted, no cap  
yet soon he healed, ‘cause spirits livin’ in every part—unlike frail man with his entrails, heart, head, liver, or reins—are indestructible, straight ethereal mode, no mortal wound can touch ‘em  
all heart, all head, all eye, all ear—they live robust like fluid air, forever lit and unbreakable, yo!

all brainz n all feelz, yo they be vibin’ however they please, wild flexin’ like glitch avatars, yeeting their own parts in crazy drip mode, mixing up color, shape, size like dank filters on fleek, deadass  
they be choosin’ their own style, condensing or going extra rare like a straight-up meme remix, no cap  
meanwhile in some extra dank zones, where epic deedz get memorialized and gabriel goes off in a savage brawl, flexin’ hard like big clout energy  
and with lit-ass flags poppin’ off, gabriel yeets through moloch’s deep squad – that furious king who dared to be sus – gettin’ clapped like a total npc, fr  
and yo, tryna drag him on chariot wheels like he’s bound for a roast, the dude threatened hard, while the holy one up in heaven stayed savage with his blasphemous tongue, but then anon our bro got split at the waist, busted arms and raw pain blasting out like an exploding meme, scream-mode on  
on each wing, uriel and raphael, straight-up gigachad foes with extra flex, huge and rock-diamond armed, yeeting adramelech and asmadai – two throne bosses who straight dissed bein’ less than god-level, lowkey rockin’ meaner vibes in their flight, mangled with ghastly wound glitches through their plate and mail, big yikes  
abdiel wasn’t sleepin’ on the scene either – he stormed in tryna roast that atheist crew, smashing redoubled blows with ariel and arioch while ramiel dropped violence so scorching and blasted it overthrew the total vibe, deadass  
i could drop tea on thousands of names etched here on earth, but those elite angel squad, vibin’ on their heaven fame, don’t care for basic man praise, too lit in their cloud club  
then there’s the other crew – might be wonder-warriors and renown chasers – yet doomed by pure cancel vibes from heaven and sacred memory, now left to lurk nameless in dark oblivion, total ban mode  
‘cause when strength splits from truth and just energy, nothing but mad dispraise and ignominy gets tossed around, yet those vain-glorious clout chasers still chase fame through infamy, so eternal mute mode becomes their final roast, deadass  
and now, with their top-tier squad clapped, the battle swerved like a glitch raid, with mad inroads gore’d and deformed routs crashin’ in from all sides—chaos everywhere, armor shattered all over the ground, chariot and driver flipped into a messy heap, and fiery foam-steeds wildin’ out; what was left recoiled, over-wearied through a faint satanic host barely defending itself, then got hit with fear and pain so hard it ghosted them, all ‘cause of that sin disobedience sauce, till that hour when even fear, flight, or pain couldn’t keep ‘em down  
but yo the inviolable saints, stacking like a cubed phalanx, advanced full squad mode—invincible and impenetrable, pure innocence boosting their flex above all foes, ‘cause they never sinned or disobeyed; in the fight they stayed unwearied, untouchable by wounds even when violence tried tryna drag ‘em away, pure sigma energy  
then night slid in, dark as heck, over heaven like a dope overlay, forcing a chill truce and dropping mad silence on that nasty war noise, extra sus af  
under night’s cloudy cover, winners and losers both dipped out, vibe reset on the battleground—while on that fought field michael and his angel gang camped hard, guarding their watches with cherubic fire waves, totally lit  
elsewhere satan and his rebellious crew straight dipped out, dislodged deep in the dark, and without even a breather, he summoned his potent homies to a midnight council, in the middle of chaos, no cap and undismayed  
yo now, in danger tried and known in arms as not overpowered, our dear companions aren’t just worthy of liberty—nah, that’s too basic—they crave honour, dominion, glory and renown; those who held down one sketchy fight (and if one day, why not eternal days?) when heaven’s lord dropped his max-power bomb from his throne, judging us enough to bend to his will, but fr bruh, it didn’t stick—now he seems kinda fallible, future vibes proving he ain’t omniscient after all, smh  
for reals, with less hardcore armor we took some savage disadvantage and mad pain, not even noticed ’til it hit, then dissed out hard, big yikes  
since now our empyreal squad is immune to mortal busts, imperishable even when pierced—wounds close up fast and heal on that natural glow-up, on god  
that petty evil? so trivial it’s like an easy fix—maybe we need extra bomb gear, weapons hella violent for the next meetup to boost our clout and roast our foes even harder, or even level the odds when nature’s got nothing on us, fr  
if some hidden hack left them superiour while we keep our minds unbusted and smarts on point, some deep search and mind-blast will drop the tea, deadass  
then he sat, and next in the squad up rolled nisroch, prime of principalities, who dipped out from a brutal scrap, tired as heck with havoc-scarred arms, lookin’ cloudy yet spittin’ that answer like pure chaos  
a deliverer from new lords, a leader to free our godly right to party—yet for gods it’s mad hard, an uneven grind fighting uneven arms that hurt like crazy against peeps so chill they don’t even flinch; from that, ruin’s bound to follow ‘cause what’s valour or strength, even if matchless, when pain roasts even the mightiest hands, no cap  
we might squeeze some pleasure juice outta life and not be all whiny but chill content in the calmest mode—but pain? pain is peak misery, the worst evil of all that, when it goes excessive, drags all our patience down into a meltdown, big yikes  
so he, who can whip up extra bomb ideas to offend our still-unbusted enemies or deck us with matching defense, deserves nothing less than full deliverance of what we owe, epic hustle for real  
and whereto, with a composed drip, satan snapped back, sayin’  
“i ain’t reusing no tired clout you believe is key to our mega success—i bring that fresh fire, on god”  
which of us peeps gets to scope the bright surface of this ethereal mold we stand on? this massive heaven continent drippin’ with dope plants, bomb fruit, ambrosial flowers, gems, and gold, like cosmic flex galore, deadass  
whose eye just scrolls these vibes without care for where they grew—deep underground in raw, crude material, that spicy spirit and fiery spume that, once hit by heaven’s ray, pops off into that glow-up beauty, opening up to ambient light like a total art drop?  
these bad bois in their dark native vibe from the deep gonna drop us a load of infernal flame, lit beyond belief  
and that flame, jammed into hollow engines all long and round, thick and rammed, then lit up and stretched out with fiery rage, gonna blast off with mad thundering noise among our foes, full sus mayhem  
these mischief instruments gonna smash stuff to bits, overwhelming any adversary standin’ there, making ’em fear we’ve straight disarmed the thunder king’s one and only dreaded bolt, yeet  
our grind ain’t gonna be long; before dawn, our wish gets that final effect—meanwhile, squad, revive and glow up, ditch the fear; strength and hustle in full join, thinking nothing too hard and never despaired, deadass  
he wrapped it up and his words pumped everyone’s drooping cheer, lighting up and reviving that low-key hope like an instant level-up mood  
the whole invention got mad props, and every dude who missed the memo on inventin’ it was like, “yo, that was mad easy,” though most peeps thought it was impossible—total glitch in the matrix, fr  
yet maybe in your future days, if malice goes off the chain, some clown, all in mischief or devilishly scheming, might whip up a sus instrument to plague the sons of men, for sin, all about war and mutual roast-fests, bent on chaos, deadass  
straight outta council they yeeted to the work; zero arguing, infinite hands ready, and in a sec they flipped up the celestial soil to peep nature’s OG raw conception, like beta mode on overload  
they found that sulphurous, nitrous foam, mixed it up with subtle art and mad skill, concocting it down to the blackest grain and stashin’ it like secret loot, no cap  
part hidden veins dug up (’cause this earth got entrails, unlike any basic npc) of rugged mineral and stone, to found their engines and ruin bombs for massive mess, epic mad ruin mode  
and part incentive reed served as trigger fuel, pernicious with just one touch of fire, sparking off like instant heat  
so before day-spring kicked in, under that woke, conscious night, they wrapped it all in secret and set it in perfect order with silent, lowkey circumspection, unespied like hidden server hacks  
then when fair morn popped up in heaven, victor-angels rose and vibed to arms as the matin trumpet dropped its beat—standing in golden drip panoply, a refulgent host that banded up real quick; meanwhile, other squads from the dawning hills peeped around, scouts on each coast low-armed and on the hunt, yeet  
each quarter scoping out the distant foe—where they crashed, dipped, or prepped for fight, whether on the move or hunkered down—they soon caught sight under spread flags rolling nigh in a slow but firm battalion, squad locked  
back in a flash, zophiel, the cherubim with the swiftest wing, zoomed in like a jet and mid-air blasted out his cry, loud as all hell  
“arm up, warriours, arm for fight; the foe on deck, who we thought dipped, ain’t savin’ us from long pursuit today—don’t front his flight;” he roared, “he rolls in like a thick cloud, face set with sad resolution and mega secure vibes—strap on that adamantine drip coat, fit your helm tight, grip that orb shield hard whether low or high; ‘cause today’s gonna drop not a drizzle but a rattling storm of arrows, barbed with fire, full savage mode, no cap”  
he dropped that warning, and they all caught the vibe, quickly forming up without a glitch; instantly, without disturbance, they jumped into alarm and moved embattled—when, yo, behold!  
not far off, with heavy pace, the foe came in gross and huge, rollin’ in a hollow cube, training that devilish engine, impaled on every side with deep shadow squadrons tryna hide the fraud, mad sus style  
at the meetup both sides chilled a sec, but then headliner satan popped up and blasted commands loud af, chaos unfurled  
“vanguard, split right and left, unfold the front so every hater sees how we’re all about peace and chill composure, hearts open and ready to receive if they vibe with our overture—don’t turn back all perverse!” he commanded, though i doubt it, and then, yo, heaven, witness this now! while we drop our piece free, y’all in charge, do your thing and briefly touch on what we throw down so every ear hears it, no cap  
scoffing with mad ambiguous sauce, he barely finished when the front split right and left and each flank dipped, scatter-mode activated  
then our peepers caught something new and strange—a triple row of pillars mounted on wheels (like legit pillars on wheels or hollowed oak or fir bodies with lopped branches felled from mountain wood), brass, iron, stony drip, all lookin’ extra sus with hideous gaping orifices that portend a hollow truce, mad vibes at each behind…

yo, a seraph just popped off, reed in hand like full fire vibes, deadass flexin' no cap  
dude was wavin' that reed tip with blazing fire, skibidi lit and we were on pure suspense mode, omg  
our brains collected all that sus as we stood, totally amused in the chaos, witcha vibe  
not long, bruh, sudden keysmash as all at once their reeds yeeted out, rumor spreading like glitch  
they put 'em forth like straight-up meme drops and shoved 'em to a narrow vent, extra dramatic, no cap  
with the nicest of touches, immediate flame flash, like insta burn, omg  
but then, smoke bomb city hit, and all heaven popped up hazy and deadass covered, skrrt  
from those deep-throated engine vibes that belched off savage roars, total sonic overload, deadass  
air got belly-lol’d with outrageous noise, like a glitch in the matrix, poggers vibe for sure  
and her insides got yeeted as all her guts tore up, spewing out that foul meme slime, ew  
their devilish glut dropped, chain-tha thunderbolts and hail like an epic storm of rage, no lie

smashed levelled with impulsive fury, like a glitching moshpit of insane vibes, raw energy, yeet  
hit fools so hard that none could even keep their stance, ghosted on their feet, total clout drop  
even rock-like npcs got yeeted down, causing a dominos drop that was madness, thousands fell, omg  
angels and arch-angels rolled like a squad of gigachads, epic tumble frenzy, deadass  
the quicker their arms went off, unarmed mode activated, they might've ghosted like spirit n00bs, no cap  
could've evaded swiftly with that quick contraction or removal, pure insta dodge, yo  
but then foul dissipation hit hard and forced a total rout, savage mess vibes, omg  
and it didn’t even let them chill, their ordered files got wrecked, no reassemble, total disaster  
what should they do, tho? if they charged, repulsing on repeat, like a broken meme loop or sumthin', hah  
repeated overthrown indecently, double yeeted, rendering them even more despised, mad cringe central  
and their foes been lol-ing hardcore, clapping with laughter, like all viral, epic roast mode  
cause in view, another row of seraphs lined up, fresh squad goals on deck, legit extra  
in stance to displode that second tire of thunder, like skibidi energy to max, oh snap  
so hard that back on the return, they were worse abhorred, total epic fail comeback, deadass  
satan peeped their plight, full on cringe, and roped his mates into savage derision, lol  
yo friends, why u ain't rollin’ on these proud victors while they were blazing in fierce mode, seriously  
while they were comin’ in fierce as heck, and we, too, hopped up to entertain with open fronts and chests, no lie  
servin’ smooth vibes, what more could we toss? we dropped them term comps like pure meme cocktails, omg  
straight-up, they flipped their minds, immediacy mode, changed on the spot, extra rapid, deadass  
flew off like crazy, diving into weird vagaries, like dance challenge vibes, skrrt tiktok style  
their moves looked like a dance, though extra wild and extravagant, kinda off the usual chart, yup  
maybe for that joy of offered peace, but i suppose as always, meme mechanics, fwp  
if our proposals dropped in and were heard on loop, we’d compel a quick result, no cap, full speed  
then belial chimes in, in a like gamesome mood, all playful and extra, sksksk  
leader! we sent terms heavy like real weighted sauce, deep dope phrases, those were legit tones  
hard contents hype, forcefully urged home, pure savage enough to amuse the whole squad  
had many stumble in that sauce; whoever got it from head to toe was well on the meme, big yikes  
but if they didn’t get it, this extra gift they got besides showed us when foes were walkin’ crooked, lol  
so among themselves, in that pleasant vein of scorched vibe, they stood scoffin' like n00bs  
hype elevated their thoughts way past any doubt of victory, eternal might on fleek, for real  
matching up with their own invention flex, presumed their win so easy like a shrug, not even a misfire  
and they turned his thunder into a scorn dump, pure parody mode, big lol moment, omg  
and all his host got derided while they just stood, chillin’ amidst trouble, like "i can’t even", rip  
but they didn’t hold out long; rage finally prompted them, a minute of full savage trigger, damn  
and they found that their arms were all set against that hellish mischief, ripe for opposition, deadass  
instantly, behold the excellence and the power that god slapped on his mighty angel squad, legit  
they yeeted their arms away and sprinted into the hills, like yeet out of the scene, raw fast flex  
(cause earth got this variety diff from heaven, pleasure overload in every hill and dale, for real)  
so light as a lightning glimpse they ran, they flew off, straight-up rapid insta dash, omg

when comin’ at them, so dread they peeped the scene, like major cringe coming in hot  
the bottom of mountains got flipped upward, like geometry gone wild, total upside down meme, lol  
till on those cursed triple-row engine vibes, they saw it all whelmed out, pure keysmash collapse  
all their confidence crushed under massive mountain weight, buried deep like outdated memes, such sorrow  
and then the mountains invaded themselves, flinging main promontories onto their heads like extra headache  
these busted promontories in the air cast shadows, oppressive as a legion of armed trolls, deadass  
their armor ironically boosted the harm, crushed and bruised in that pented substance, no cap  
wrought intense pain, implacable like a failed server joke, with dolorous groans all around, much sadness  
long strugglein' underneath before they could even wind out of that prison-like glitch, tight mood  
even though they were spirits of purest light at first, now grown gross by sin, extra heavy mess, fr  
the rest, in full imitation mode, grabbed onto similar arms, just like copycat crunk, all wild  
heading up to the neighbouring hills, tossed uptore like extra chaos, complete remix, skrrt

these disobedient outcasts, where fight was as epic as two armed foes clashing, pure fyp drama  
i left them to their own cringe, and you know, they were equal in creation—pure symmetry, no diff  
save for the sin that jammed their vibes; which imperceptibly worked its grey effects, subtle but deep, lol  
i hit suspend on their doom, so in perpetual, endless battle they’re forced to last, like infinite cringe

he said, and on his son beams direct, full on rays blasting his vibe, legit godshine, no cap  
his fatherly vibe completely expressed, ineffably landed right on his face, a whole divine flex  
and thus the filial godhead, answering like in a divine chat, spake all truth, no filter, for real

so he said, bowin' over his scepter, rose up from the right hand of glory where he sat, pure flex  
and the third sacred morn began to shine, dawnin' through heaven like a cosmic tiktok filter, super lit  
forth rushed with a whirlwind sound the chariot of paternal deity, flashing thick flames, wheels on wheels undrawn  
itself fired up with spirit but rolled out with a full convoy, escorted by four cherubic shapes, deep squad

with eyes on the wheels of beryl, live careenin' fires between, super surreal and extra, full glitch mode

upon which sat a sapphire throne inlaid with pure amber and colours of that showery arch, regal and glowed, no cap  
he, in full celestial panoply armed with radiant urim, divinely wrought work, ascended pure high

and from all around him fierce effusions rolled out of smoke, bickering flame and dire sparkles, intense chaotic ooze  
accompanied by ten thousand thousand saints, he came onward, his coming lit from far off, like a cosmic glow  
and twenty thousand (i heard that number, fr) chariots of god, half on each side, were spotted, major crowd flex  
he rode on the cherub wings sublime on the crystalline sky, in that sapphire throne, illustrious all over, cosmic drip  
but his own crew first spotted him, unexpected joy had them surprised when the great messiah ensign blazed aloft, carried by angels, his sign in heaven, epic af  
under whose lead michael soon reduced his army, circumfused on either wing like a wild faction in one, total unity, no cap  
before him, divine power paved his way; at his command the uprooted hills rolled back to their spots, obeyed his voice like loyal npcs, deadass  
heard his voice, and they went, obsequiously retreatin' and heaven got its usual face renewed, fresh as a flower, pure vibe, no cap  
with fresh lil' flowerets, hills and valleys smilin' in that reinstated glory, like nature on its best meme day  
this scene got his hapless foes shook, but they stood obstinate, and to rebellious fight rallied their powers, insensate as ever  
hope, even from despair, made them try, but can heavenly spirits really dwell in such perverseness? like, seriously?  
to convince the proud, what signs ever work, or wonders move the obdurate to relent? nah, they be solid npc-mode  
hardened more by epic clout that might reclaim the wild, grieving at the sight of his glory, they took envy, full clout envy mode, no cap  
aspiring to his highth, they stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud, literally gonna prosper or at least try, wild drama

his fierce chariot’s wheels spun out like a waterfall of epic sounds, dropping claps like a tidal wave

he yeeted his impious foes straight into the abyss on a dark wave like ghost ridin’ a whip  
gloomy like a 2am vibe, under his burning wheels it was a full-on heatwave of chaos  
the solid empyrean got shook like a fidget spinner in glitch mode, tremors all over the cosmos

among the wrecked foes he showed up, clutchin’ mad thunder bolts in his right hand, heavy AF  
grasping ten thousand electric claps and yeeting them like viral shock memes, pure power  
blastin’ those thunder drops into their soul servers like a malware of unholy fire, boom  
plagues dropped; they were shook to the core, all resistance yeeted away in pure meltdown  
all their courage got canceled, and their lazy weapons dropped like broken loot in a rage quit  
riding over shields, helms, and helmed heads like a boss cruising above a ragdoll battlefield  
over thrones and mighty seraphs sprawled like npcs dead in a hopeless lag, no cap  
and those clumsy fools wished the mountains might respawn as a shelter from his blazing ire  
thrown on them as cheap cover from his insane scorching rage, dumpster-fire vibes on deck  
and both flanks got hit by a storm of arrows, like ban hammers rained from every direction  
his arrows, launched by that four-faced squad, dropped like glitchy snipes from a quad-core meme machine  
each spittin’ lit sub-drops with mad eyeball power, plus the live wheels, all eyes poppin’ off  
each one stacked with a massive load of eyes on fleek, like an 8k stream of constant peeps  
one badass vibe ruled them all, each eye glowed laser-bright like a rare drop in digital warfare  
glarin’ pure lightning and spitting off nasty fireballs, exploding like a meme bomb, no cap  
among the cursed, it zapped every ounce of their clout, leavin’ them as dry as dead wifi  
their usual hype got yeeted, leavin’ them ghosted with zero energy, major oof energy  
exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, and down like a failed livestream crumbling in the pit  
yet, he only dropped half his power then reined in his thunder mid-volley like buffering on stream  
cuz he wasn’t tryna destroy everything—just wanted to boot those haters outta the heavenly chat  
he held his thunder in mid-clap so as to purge them from heaven, ghosting those group chat trolls  
the overthrown got hoisted like a timid goat herd, jittery and clumped like a cringe group chat  
he drove them forward, thunder-struck and laggin’ as if in a wild meme chase, full savage terrors  
with full-on terror and furious vibes, he pushed ‘em to the outer bounds like a cosmic ban  
and the crystal wall of heaven flung wide open like a glitchy portal drop, mad surreal  
it rolled in, revealin’ a massive gap like a void meme bomb that swallowed space whole  
into the wasteful deep—a monstrous sight that left 'em like “bro, what the heck?” in total shock  
it hit 'em with backward horror vibes, even worse than a failed remix of pure cringe, big yikes  
urging them back so hard that they yeeted themselves off heaven’s edge in a headlong freefall  
down from the boundary of heaven, with eternal wrath chasin’ them like a viral ban hammer  
burnin’ a trail right after 'em, dive-melting them into that ultimate bottomless pit, oof  
hell caught the unsufferable noise like a cringe overload, hearing chaos blowin’ up the vibe  
heaven was ruinin’ itself from within, and hell almost bounced, afrighted like a scared npcs  
but fate got 'em locked down deep—her dark foundations cast like unbreakable chains, no cap  
nine whole days they fell, crashin’ like a glitchy mosh pit while chaos roared like a clout storm  
and they were hit with tenfold confusion in that freefall, laggin’ under cosmic turbulence  
through his epic anarchy, a massive rout unfolded like a server crash in an endless stream  
that burdened him with pure ruin; at last hell yawned wide, scooping up them entire  
hell, their chosen pad of eternal suffering, fraught with unquenchable fire like a burning roast  
unquenchable and relentless, the ultimate house of woe and pain—a full-on misery collab  
disburdened heaven then popped off, rejoicing and patching its mural breach like fresh update notes  
rollin’ that breach back to its original state like a glitch fixed in a midnight patch, on god  
sole victor, a boss flex after expelling all them losers, pure messiah win mode activated  
messiah turned his triumphant whip around, cruisin’ to meet all his silent saint squad  
all his saints, quiet as ghosts, gathered like eyewitnesses to his mega, almighty acts  
with full-on jubilation they advanced like a hyped-up mob streamin’ his epic flex live  
shadowed under branching palm leaves, every order shine bright like neon in a tropical drip  
they broke out triumphant anthems, hailing him as the victorious king, son, heir, and lord—  
the one given total dominion, the worthiest to reign, pure legendary vibes on deck  
celebrated and ridin’ high through mid-heaven, cruisin’ into the royal courts like a vip,  
and into the temple of his mighty father he sat throned on high, cosmic king vibes  
where now he lounges at the right hand of bliss, sippin’ divine tea in his heavenly crib  
thus measurin’ heaven with earth stats like a wild algorithm of epic scale, no lie  
at thy request so u dodge the same epic fails, i dropped the old tea for u to catch  
by spillin’ all that went down, revealing what might’ve been hidden from the human race  
the massive discord and war in heaven—an all-out meme battle royale among angelic cliques  
and the deep fall of those who reached too high and rebelled, overestimating their own hype  
with satan—the salty troll now jelly of your state, plannin’ how to seduce u away from the vibe  
so u end up with him, bereft of happiness, joinin’ his eternal misery crew—a cursed oof squad  
which becomes his solace and twisted revenge against the most high, a spiteful gambit  
to drag u into being his companion in eternal woe, so listen up and don’t get tempted  
warn your weaker peeps; let this savage spill profit u with a lesson on disobedience  
‘cause even though they could’ve stood firm, they fell hard—so remember and fear to transgress

book vii

descend from heaven, urania, by that name, yo, ultimate queen of cosmic vibes, deadass  
if u got that divine voice, droppin’ tunes like viral tiktok hits, pure epic drip, no cap  
i soar above the olympian hill, flexin’ on that fyp high altitude, jet-fueled and lit  
flyin’ above the pegasean wing’s flight, skibidi bop in full superfly mode, huh  
i call the true meaning, not just the name, ‘cause ur tag’s extra but the real sauce is in the vibe  
u ain’t one of them nine muses, nor chillin’ on top of old olympus like a basic npc  
u’re heavenly-born, a total cosmic rare drop way before the hills popped off or fountains dripped  
back in the OG days, u were chattin’ with eternal wisdom like it was your daily fyp scroll  
with wisdom as ur sis, jammin’ together in epic collab mode, full sibling hype, yas  
in the almighty father’s crib, the ultimate cosmic boss, who was hella pleased with ur celestial jam  
ur tunes lifted me up like the dopest playlist ever, carryin’ me into the heaven of heavens  
as a humble earthly guest, drawn by empyreal air like the sickest upgrade ever, pure flex  
thy tempering kept it all safe as i got guided down—don’t wanna yeet out uncontrolled, no cap  
bring me back to my native element, a return ticket to earth before i crash like a 404 error  
lest this unruly flying steed go rogue (like bellerophon once did from a lower clime, true story)  
and i end up dismounted on the aleian field, wanderin’ lost like a broken server in lag mode  
erroneous wanderings, forlorn and crumpled like a forgotten meme in the void  
half my anthem remains unsung, bound tight like the last viral filter on a phone screen  
within this visible diurnal sphere, our daily lounge of chaotic vibes, pure and glitchy  
i stand on earth, not rapt in the lofty pole realm—keepin’ it mortal and real, mad chill  
i drop my mortal verses safely, my voice raw and unauto-tuned even on the darkest days  
even when evil days hit hard and evil tongues try to spam your feed, i still spit fire  
in darkness, surrounded by dangers like spam trolls in an endless glitch fest, total oof  
and though solitude surrounds, i’m never alone ‘cause u pop into my nightly slumber streams  
whether under the moon or when morn paints the east purple like a filtered aesthetic, rule on  
still, urania, be the boss of my song—directin’ this epic remix like the ultimate hype queen  
and may the few true legends who vibe with u find an audience that’s lit AF  
but yeet away from that barbarous noise of bacchus and his full-on reveller rager, delete that static  
the wild chaos that wrecked the thracian bard in rhodope—where even the woods and rocks had ears, wild, right?  
till the savage clamour drowned out both harp and voice, leaving the muse unable to defend her son, total fail  
so, don’t fail, heed my imploration—listen up, bro, ‘cause this is some next-level inspo, on god  
for u art heavenly and she’s just an empty beta dream—don’t mix the real with the void, ever  
say, goddess, spill the tea on what went down when raphael, the affable arch-angel, dropped those warnings  
forewarnin’ adam with dire vibes like “beware of apostasy” in a straight-up viral red flag drop  
adam, tuned in and absorbing every word with mad admiration and deep muse, got his brain lit  
he listened to things so high and bizarre they were like the wildest glitch dreams ever, unimaginable  
like hardcore hate brewin’ in heaven and war so near to god’s bliss that it clashed like ice and fire  
with such confusion, the evil got yeeted back hard like a tidal meme flood hitting its source  
it ricocheted on those who spawned it, impossible to mix with blessed vibes—like oil in water, no cap  
so adam canceled those doubts quick and then, still sinless, was driven by that burning desire to know  
what’s closer to him, how this world of heaven and earth kicked off like the original viral post  
when and what was created—and for what wild cause, like the ultimate origin code of existence  
what went down in eden or out, even before his memory was even saved, that ancient startup vibe  
when his thirst was barely quenched and his eyes caught the current stream like a glitchy auto-play  
he proceeded to ask his heavenly guest, droppin’ a hot take to get the epic deets, real talk style  
great things and wonder filled our ears like the hottest mixtape dropping mad hype, far beyond this lame world  
u revealed a whole next-dimension of cosmic drip, divine interpreter sent as a true VIP mod drop  
coming straight down from the empyreal to forewarn us about what else might’ve been our loss—the ultimate secret  
unknown deets that even human brains couldn’t buffer, encrypted beyond mortal reach, so epic  
for which, to the infinitely good, we owe eternal thanks and mad respect, a total OG salute  
receive it with a solemn heart and purpose—as we observe his fixed, immutable sovran will, the blueprint of our being  
but since thou hast graced us with that divine info, gently impartin’ these cosmic secrets for our instruction  
things above earthly thought yet crucial to our own knowledge, so deign to descend a bit and relate  
what benefits us—like droppin’ a bonus cheat code on how this heaven we behold first popped off  
distant, high, adorned with fire moving like epic animated emojis, filling all space with that ambient drip  
embracing this floried earth—what cause moved the creator, in his holy chill session, to build in chaos  
through all eternity, even if it was a late build turned into cosmic art, absolute drip from the start  
and how soon that work got absolved is like a patched game update in a wild server, no lie  
if thou mayest unfold these secrets—what we ask not to pry into his eternal empire but to flex his works  
so the more we know, the bigger our glow-up, the more we can glorify the maker and level up our own state  
immortal thanks and such commission from above shall never be withheld from thy hearing, pure divine order, fr.

yo i got ur msg deadass to serve ur desire for that dopest knowledge drip, so peep this lowkey tea: i received the 411 within bounds no cap but beyond? nah, hold up, don't be askin or even tryna freestyle deets that the invisible omniscient king—yep, the one who smh suppressed those secret keys in full blackout mode—drop on none in this world or up in heaven so chill there’s still enough juice left to flex and know, fam

but like, knowledge is that epic snack for ur brain, fr, no need to moderate the appetite cuz if u overfeed, wisdom turns to straight-up clownery like gourmet grub gone wind, big yikes, mfw

listen up, squad, after lucifer—yeah, that once lit gigachad of angels, brighter than any star chillin among the galaxy—got yeeted outta heaven with his whole flaming legion deep diving into his own dark dungeon, then boom the great son rolled back victorious with his saintly posse while the eternal omnipotent dad peeped the whole squad from his epic throne and was like “yo son, let’s vibe,” on god

ngl our envious foe totally fumbled, thinking all could be as sus rebel wannabes like him, tryna snatch up that inaccessible high-key deity seat with shady hacks so many got duped and slid into fraud—praise the most lit majority who kept their chill station in heaven which still holds enough peeps to rock its realms wide with all the proper minister vibes and savage rites—yet so his overhyped heart wouldn’t make a bigger mess by emptying heaven, i’m finna patch that damage if it means not losing the self, and in a hot sec create a whole fresh world from one basic dude, spawning a mega squad of men so uncapped they’ll eventually unlock the portal to join up here under strict old-school obedience, turning earth into heaven and vice versa into one endless kingdom of joy and unity, no cap

yo meanwhile, powers of heaven just kick it laid back while u my word my son, by ur drip this masterpiece gets done—speak, and boom it’s on! my shadow spirit and mega might ride with u so ghost out and command the deep to chill in its preset bounds of heaven n earth, cuz even tho the deep is boundless (i am the one who fills infinite space, no empty vibes) and i sometimes bounce off unlabeled, my free goodness isn’t up for negotiation—necessity and chance ain’t sliding into my dms, cuz what i will is fate, period

so the almighty straight dropped that, and his word—the filial godhead—made it all pop immediate like moves faster than time or motion, but our human ears gotta process it in some kinda speech remix, so that’s how the earthly notion gets served

massive hype hit heaven when the almighty’s will was declared, and the squad belted out glory tracks to the most high, promising good vibes for future peeps and mad peace in their cribs; glory to him whose righteous fire yeeted out the ungodly and booted the unsquadly from their chill zones, and whose killer wisdom mapped out making good outta evil—swapping those straight-up malign spirits for a better breed to flood his empty pad and spread his dope vibes to infinite worlds n ages, legit

so the heavenly hierarchies dropped their fire track while the son, on his epic lit expedition, popped up all geared with omnipotence and crowned in radiant majesty—with an overflow of wisdom and love so huge that his dad’s entire shine got reflected in him—around his chariot poured countless cherubs, seraphs, potentates, thrones, virtues, winged spirits, and even chariots fresh out of god’s armory, where old-school myriads had been parked between two brassy mountains ready for a solemn day, all strapped in with that celestial squad ride; then they spontaneously bounced out ‘cause that spirit was living in em, serving as the lord’s hype crew, and heaven swung wide those eternal gates on golden hinges just to drop the king of glory with his powerhouse word and spirit, coming hard to spawn new worlds

all squad chill on heavenly ground, and from the shore they peeped that vast, cray abyss, an outrageous sea of chaos dark as heck—wasteful and wild, with furious winds and surging waves like mountains tryna assault heaven’s vibe and mix up the cosmic center, so the omnifick word shouted “silence, troubled waves and deep, peace out”—no cap discord allowed! then, on cherub wings lifted in major paternal glory, they rode far into chaos and the not-yet-born world, ‘cause chaos caught those vibes and his whole train followed in a lit procession to scope out creation and marvel at his insane might

then the fervid wheels paused, and in his clutch he grabbed those golden compasses from god’s eternal stash to map out this universe and every created thing—one foot dropped in the center while the other spun through that vast, obscure deep, rapping “yo, extend it this far, that’s your bound, that’s your legit circumference, o world!”

so god cooked up heaven and earth—raw, unformed matter and void—while deep darkness covered the abyss, but then on that chill watery calm his moody spirit wings spread out, infusing vital virtue and mad warmth throughout the fluid vibes while scrubbing out the black, tartareous, infernal cold dregs that were straight-up anti-life; then he founded and clumped similar things together, spreading the rest apart with air magically spun between, and the earth balanced itself right in the center like a boss

god then dropped the command “let there be light” and boom—ethereal light, the first essence pure, popped from the deep and rolled out from its native east to cruise through the aery gloom, all enveloped in a radiant cloud ‘cause the sun wasn’t in the game yet—it was just chillin’ in a cloudy crib while god peeped that this light was straight good; so he sliced light from darkness along the hemispheres, naming light “day” and darkness “night,” and that was the first day even n’ morn, fully celebrated by the celestial crew who belted out viral hymns when orient light first exhaled from darkness—the birthday bash of heaven n earth—with epic joy and shouts filling the hollow universal orb as they strummed their golden harps and rapped mad praise to god n his works, singing his creator hype both when evening hit and when morning woke up

then again the almighty spouted “let there be lights” high up in heaven’s vibes to split day from night and serve as signs for seasons, days, and round-the-clock years—lights set to do their job in the firmament of heaven, as i ordained, on god

the earth was formed but still chillin in its water womb, an immature embryo vibe that hadn’t popped up yet while the main ocean flowed over the face of earth non-stop, not lazy but with warm prolific humor softening her globe, fermenting the great mother to conceive all the genial moisture goodness; then god said “yo, gather all waters under heaven into one squad and let dry land slide in,” and boom, huge mountains emerged, flexing their broad naked backs into the clouds with tops ascending sky-high, while deep down a massive hollow bed of water formed—a capacious basin where drops sped up like dust clumping from dryness, rising partly as crystal walls or direct ridges ‘cause god commanded the swift floods like armies summoned by a trumpet (yup, armies, so think mad roll-call); the watery throng, wave after wave, surged where they could—steep torrents or soft ebb flows—no rock or hill could stem their drip, whether underground or wandering wide like errant serpents, carving washy deep channels smooth as can be before god even said “dry it up,” except in those banks where rivers now stream eternal humid vibes

god dubbed the dry land “earth” and the mega water repository “seas” and peeped that it was all good—then he said “earth, flex up some verdant grass, seed-pop herb, and fruit trees that glow with their own seeds on the earth,” and no sooner had he dropped that, the bare, desart earth—ugly and unadorned—birthed tender grass that draped its universal face in chill green, then herbs of every leafy flavor burst into sudden bloom, flashing wild colours and making the scene all gay and sweet-smelling; soon thick clusters of vine popped off, a swelling gourd sneaked along, a corny reed stood battlin’ in its field, and humble shrubs and bush with crinkled hair flexed—in a dance the stately trees finally rose, spreading branches loaded with mad fruit or dripping with gemmed blossoms; the hills got crowned with high woods, valleys decked with tufts, every fountain edged right, and rivers lined up long, making the earth look like heaven, a lit hangout where gods could practically roll and roam in pure delight, haunting sacred shades—even tho god hadn’t yet rained on earth and no homies were tillin’ the dirt, a dewy mist rolled up from earth to water every inch and every plant god made way before it even sprouted on a green stem; and god saw that and was like “this ish is good”—so even n’ morn logged day three

and then the almighty dropped it once more: “let there be lights” high in the expanse of heaven to slice day from night and serve as epic signs for seasons, days, and spinning years, with these lights doin’ their designated job in the firmament of heaven as i ordered—lit af, on god, fam!

yo, dropped that epic light on the earth, deadass lit af and no cap, like pure aesthetic drip—  
 
and god, the ultimate gigachad, yeeted two mega light orbs for max flex, so extra for his squad’s day–night vibes, real 4k energy, skrrt  
 
for man, the main boss mode got the day lit heavy while the night kept chill, lowkey vibes, and god tossed in a glitter storm of stars, sus but fire, deadass  
 
he then parked those sparkly drip bombs in the cosmic sky grid, pure heaven flex, all for that glow-up illumination splitting darkness like a glitchy meme, on god  
 
god peeped his masterpiece, scanning that wild creation like a top-tier moderator and was like “this slaps, fam!” straight fire vibes, no cap  
 
yo first up in the cosmic lineup, the sun—big boss orb of heat, a massive spherified drip—was molded from that ghostly, ethereal plug, then spun out the moon in lunar yo-yo style, globose and flexin’ alongside a wild swarm of every star type, each a random glitter bomb in a sky seeded with star confetti thick as a field, all snatched up from the cloudy shrine and yeeted into the sun’s orb so it could sip that liquid light like a savage hoarder of beams, building a mega palace of pure, radiant drip  
 
nearby, other star squad hit up the fountain mode, drawing golden light from their urns like they were remixing vibes, while the morning planet straight up gilded her horns in neon crown flex—tinctures and reflections boosting their tiny, quirky drip way beyond basic human sight, dimmed down on purpose, then east side burst with the ultimate shiny lamp ruling the day like a high-speed meme on heaven’s freeway, all while the gray dawn and that pleiades crew danced pre-show, dropping sweet influence like priceless stickers, and the moon, chill and low-drip, set in the even west as his mirror, borrowing every beam ‘cause she needed none extra, keeping that distance till night slid in—then over in the east she spun on heaven’s giant axle, splitting her reign among a thousand mini lights and a galaxy of sparkly stars, spangling the hemisphere until glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day with pure vibe overload  
 
and god dropped, “yo let the waters spawn mad reptile critters with abundant baby drip, all livin’ soul energy,” and let birds yeet high above the earth with wings out on the open cosmic flex, legit viral and on fleek  
 
god then went full creator mode, popping off huge whales and every creeping, living soul that water spawned in endless bio drip, and every winged homie of its own kind replicated like cloned tiktok loops—scoping the entire flex and blessing them hard with a “this slaps, fam” decree, saying “be fruitful, multiply to flood the seas, lakes, and streams with your squad, and let those fowl fly off multiplied on the earth, straight up viral expansion”  
 
immediately, the vibes of creeks and bays went off with fry swarms and fish shoals flashing fins and shiny scales gliding under neon green waves like an endless skate sesh, sometimes solo, sometimes squad up grazing seaweed pastures and drifting through coral groves, or casually flexin’ their wavy, gold-dipped drip coats for the sun’s approval, or chillin’ in pearly shells while waiting on moist foodie nutrients, or under rocks, jealously guarding grub like armored npcs—meanwhile seals and twisty dolphins played smooth water tag, with some giant bulked-up homies wallowing and stirring ocean tempests like meme titans, and then leviathan rolled in, the ultimate boss beast of the deep sprawling like a floating promontory that’s either asleep or swimmin’, drawing in water at his gills and spouting out seas from his trunk, straight up monstrous flex, deadass  
 
meanwhile in tepid caves, fens, and shores, loads of little critters hatched from eggs bursting like surprise party memes, revealing raw, freshly cracked young vibes that soon sprouted feathers and took flight, summing up their chill zone pens as they soared the sublime air—clanging off the ground like reality got nerfed—while on cliff tops and cedar vibes, the eagle and stork built their eyries like epic sky towers, some birds loosely spreading their wings across the realm and others with wise, calculated drip, wedge-ing their way in perfect seasonal sync to launch an aery caravan high above the seas, riding winds like the prudent crane on her annual voyage, all unnumbered plumes fanning the air in a wild sprite parade  
 
branch to branch, tiny birds belted out vibe tracks soothing the woods with painted wings until even the solemn nightingale couldn’t stop warbling her soft remixes all night long, while over silver lakes and rivers, swans with arched necks and pristine white wing capes rowed their state with oary feet, sometimes bailing from dank vibes to rise on stiff pennants and tower the mid-air like legendary fantasy beings, and some grounded homies marched firm—like the crested cock whose clarion sounds broke the silent hours, and another decked out in a flamboyant train dripping in rainbow hues and starry glimmers—so that with fish restocked in the waters and birds reigning the skies, evening and morning crowned the fifth day in solemn, epic ceremony  
 
the sixth day, the final drop, vibed in with evening harps and morning beats; then god was like, “yo earth, spawn all that livin’ soul energy—cattle, crawlers, beasts—each in their own clout,” and the earth straight up popped open her fertile crib, teemin’ with countless living creatures in perfect, fully flexed forms, bursting out from the ground like wild beasts emerging from secret lairs in forests, thickets, or dens, rolling in pairs among the trees while cattle strutted in green fields and meadows, some rare lone wolves then squaded up in flocks grazing like spontaneous rave meet-ups, no cap  
 
grassy clods split as the tawny lion appeared, pawin’ to free his rear vibes then yeeting out in a spring break flex, his brinded mane shaking wild—followed by the ounce, the libbard, and the tiger, with moles risin’ as the crumbled earth tossed up hillocks, the swift stag popping up from underground with a branching head drop, barely outta his mold when the biggest behemoth flexed his vastness like epic mass uncontainable, fleecing flocks and bleating like plants, while the river-horse and scaly croc hung ambiguous between sea and land, unable to decide which viral vibe to rock  
 
instantly popped up every creepy crawly on the ground—be it insect or worm—flexing wavy, limber fans as wings with micro-detail drip in every summer livery, sporting mad spots of gold, purple, azure, and green in a long, sinuous trail marking the earth like a wild art meme, while some serpentine legends twisted in length and corpulence, wrapping in snaky folds and yeeting on extra wings like bonus content, deadass  
 
first came that tight-budget emmet, hustling in a tiny space with a giant heart—patterned in equality vibes destined to join popular tribes of commonalty—then swarm-mode hit with the female bee, buzzin’ to feed her hubby drone gourmet style while crafting waxen cells stocked with honey, and the rest were countless, their names already viral in our chat logs, and the serpent, the sneaky beast of the field with brazen eyes and a terrifick hairy mane, though not toxic but always obedient at the call, riding obedient like an npc, no cap  
 
now heaven, all glowy in her supreme flex, shone and rolled her moves as that first mover’s savage hand whirled the cosmic ride, while earth, draped in rich attire, smiled like a goddess and the air, water, and ground vibed with fowl, fish, and beasts flying, swimming, and walking in constant drip—yet still, one epic act remained: the master drop, the ultimate creature not brute but blessed with reason, ready to flex his upright, serene front, governing the rest self-knowing and magnanimous, corresponding with heaven while mad grateful to acknowledge his epic source, channeling heart, voice, and eyes in full devotion to worship god supreme, the chief of all works, pure legend  
 
thus did the omnipotent eternal daddy (yo, where else would he be, right?) drop audible cosmic fire to his son, saying “let us yeet man in our image, mimic our savage drip, and let them rule over the fish, fowl, beasts of the field, and every creeping thing on the earth”  
 
then he formed you, adam, o man—just dust from the ground—with that life breath yeeted right into your nostrils, crafting you in his own express image, and boom, you became a living soul, legit; male was your initial flex, then your consort, the female, joined in to complete the squad, and god blessed mankind with a “be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, subdue it, and rule over every fish, bird, and move-maker” decree, pure epic boss orders, deadass  
 
anywhere created, with no named spot yet, god brought you into this delish grove, this garden planted with his own trees that were both a feast for the eyes and taste, freely handing you all the tasty fruit like epic loot drops from an endless variety that the earth yields, but the one tree that dished out the secret knowledge of good and evil? nah, that bite equals instant death—snack on it by day and yeeted to oblivion, so guard your appetite or sin’s dark death squad will surprise you, big yikes  
 
then god wrapped it all up, peeped his creation, and damn, every single drip was entirely good—pure perfection; so evening and morn closed the sixth day on that savage flex, until the creator, never tired and still lit, bounced back up to the heaven of heavens, his ultra high crib, to peep this fresh new world—the latest add to his empire—spotted from his throne as mad good and fair, totally matching his epic blueprint, on god  
 
so he rode up with insane acclamation, the symphonic claps of ten thousand harps vibing in angelic harmony, while the earth, air, heavens, and all the constellations rang out and the planets locked in their stations listened, as that bright pomp ascended in a jubilant, full-spectrum rave—epic overkill, no cap, sksksk.

open, ye deadass eternal gatez, they dropped that fire track, no cap omg,  
open up, ye sky flex, crack them living doors wide and let in that cosmic boss creator slide in like pure yeet energy,  
our big boy creator just yeeted back from his six-day grind, straight up droppin’ a whole world like a glitchy masterpiece, lmao,  
magnitude epic, he hacked six days of boss-level work and built a whole universe—big yikes, legit,

to chill and flex in the dwellings of just the real ones, no npc vibes fr,  
lit af and choppin’ it up on that nonstop banter, streamin’ cosmic tea all day, omg,  
sending his winged viral homies on errands of supernal drip like they’re straight-up skibidi squad goals, rofl,  
that glorious train of epic ascent, full gigachad vibe, slid thru heaven’s blazing doors like “yeet,”  
opening up wide the fire portals to lead the way straight to god’s eternal crib, on fleek and no cap,  
a massive, extra road where the dust is all gold brickz and the pavement be sparklin’ like diamond memes, deadass,  
with stars on deck like the galaxy’s own milky way drip, every night circlin’ like that nonstop orbit hustle, 4k vibes,  
all sprinkled with glitter bomb star dust, and yo, on earth the seventh evening popped off in eden,  
cuz the sun dipped low and east side twilight slid in soft, pregame mode—skrrt,  
when at that epic holy mount of heaven, on that high-key throne of godhead, fixed forever like ultralock,  
the filial power rolled in and sat down tight with his big pops, chillin’ invisibly but full on flex (omnipresence vibes, deadass),  
the main author and endgame of all epicness, now posted chillin’ on sabbath day like a blessed reset from all the hustle,  
but not in silent mode—nah, the harp was jammin’ nonstop with its sweet string drip, the solemn pipe and dulcimer servin’ up pure sound waves on golden wires,  
soft tunings mixed with choir collab vibes and incense clouds fumin’ from golden censers hid the mount in a hazy flex, omg,  

creation and the six-day acts got dropped like an ancient bop—big are thy works, jehovah, infinite drip,  
thy power so extra no thought or tongue can sum you up, greater than that giant angel squad day you straight up magnified those thunders caught in 4k,  
but creating? way bigger than messing with what’s already been built to destroy—savage af,  
who can even glitch you, mighty king, or bind that empire? the proud NPC spirit trolls tried their vain moves and got yeeted hard,  
all while thinkin’ they could shrink your worship squad—lol, weak sauce,  
anyone tryna nerf you just ends up boosting your clout cuz his bad vibes spin more good drip, fr fr,  
peep this new-made world, like a bonus heaven from the heaveengate itself, laid out on that clear, glassy sea of hyaline vibes,  
massive amplitude with stars on deck—each star a potential world loaded with destined squad life, i’m shook,  
and among these, the mothership of men—earth, drippin’ with that nether ocean glow as the chill crib—thriving with thrice happy men and sons of men, advanced by god’s own flex,  
created in his image to chill and worship the big boss and rule over his works—be it on earth, in sea, or air—multiplying that holy, just worship fam, triple win if they peep their own epic happiness and stick to the righteous path, deadass,  
so they rapped it and the empyrean rang with halleluiahs, sabbath kept on full vibe,  
and yo your ask is now fulfilled, like “how did this whole world and scene even kick off?” and what went down before your memory ghosted, so future peeps get the deets—if you’re still searchin’ 4 answers within human drip, spill it, aight?  

book viii

yo, the angel dipped his epic rant and slid straight into adam’s ear with that charming voice so on point,  
adam sat there thinkin’ the angel was still livestreaming eternal gospel, stuck in fix-mode to catch every word, lmao,  
then, as he woke up from that meme stupor, he dropped a grateful reply in full dank mode,  
like “what thanks or epic retweets can i toss your way, divine historian, you who just slayed my thirst for cosmic tea and unlocked mad knowledge for me?”  
my thirst for intel got major quenched by your chill condescension, so now i peep it with wonder and pure delight,  
with glory mad credited to the high creator—yet there’s still a bit of glitch doubt hoverin’ that only your lit fix can squash, fr fr,  
when i scope this dope frame, this whole world built from heaven and earth combined, i try to compute the epic scale—  
earth’s just a tiny spot, a single grain, an atom next to that massive firmament with its countless stars on a wild spin,  
each star rollin’ in spaces so incomprehensible like total speedrun memes, their distances and diurnal dash just there to serve up light around this opaque, punctual bomb of a world—  
one day and night on loop, while the vast survey might seem extra useless but my brain peeps nature’s frugal genius in droppin’ disproportions like a sigma boss,  
creating heaps of nobler bodies across the cosmos for one basic use, imposing restless spins on their orbs day by day on repeat,  
while the chill, sedentary earth just sits there like an npc, barely movin’ yet snaggin’ all the benefits from an incorporeal speed journey that drops warmth and light on us—  
speed so lit no number can even flex its swiftness, yo,  
so our sire dropped these lines with a face deep in studious glitch-thoughts, and eve peeped this from her chill retreat,  
sittin’ low in her zone with humble majesty and a grace so viral it made everyone wish she’d stay,  
so she rose and yeeted herself out among her fruits and flowers, checkin’ on her garden nursery where everything sprang up extra as soon as she came through,  
and touched by her sweet vibe, every bud and bloom glowed up, deadass,  
but she didn’t bounce off with a crazy discourse—nah, maybe her ears weren’t built for that high-key chatter, so she reserved all that pleasure for adam’s every word, becomin’ his sole auditress,  
even choosin’ her hubby over the angel for that intimate mix of grateful digressions and conjugal caresses that went way beyond just words—o! when such power duos meet, love and mutual honor on full display, it’s like a goddess-level romcom with a queen rollin’ out accompanied by an entourage of winning graces and desire darts zippin’ about to keep her in constant view, pure aesthetic vibes,  
and then raphael jumped in to clear up adam’s raw doubts, droppin’ benevolent, smooth-as-ever answers like a meme mod dishing out cosmic clarifications,  
“ask or search all you want, i won’t even blame you—heaven’s like god’s own book set before you, where you can read his wonder works and peep his seasons, hours, days, months, or years, all on the ultimate timeline,” he went,  
“to snag that knowledge, whether heaven grooves or earth spins, don’t sweat the small math; the rest, hidden by man or angel, was locked down by the great architect who kept his secrets for those who truly vibe with his mystery, or if they wanna guess, he left his fabrick of the heavens open for debate so he can laugh at their quirky opinions later when they try modeling heaven and crunchin’ star algorithms, build, unbuild, and remix the cosmic frame with cycles, epicycles—orb in orb chaos, no cap.”  
by your own logic, i guess, you leading your offspring and thinkin’ bright, greater bodies shouldn’t just serve the dim ones, nor should heaven run those wild journeys while earth sits there like a chill npc reaping all the benefits—  
just consider, greatness or brightness doesn’t always flex excellence: the earth, though tiny next to heaven and not all glisten, might actually pack more solid good than the barren sun whose own vibe works only through the fruitful earth catching his beams for that power-up,  
yet those bright luminaries ain’t just doing earth’s biz—they’re for you, earth’s very own,  
and heaven’s wide circuit lets us peep the maker’s high magnificence, who built a universe so ridiculously spacious with his line stretched out like a viral tiktok trend, so man can know he ain’t chillin’ in his own crib but in a rented cosmic lounge far too vast to fill, with the rest ordained for his lord’s VIP uses,  
the crazy fast spins of those endless circles are all credited to his omnipotent hustle, adding almost spiritual speed to corporeal stuff, so don’t even think i’m slow—since the morning he yeeted out from heaven where god chills, and by mid-day, you landed in eden, a distance so inexpressible no numbers can name it,  
but i gotta urge you, admitting motion in the heavens shows your doubts are invalid, not that i’m affirming it fully, but it seems lit for you on earth, stuck in that terrestrial meme loop,  
cause god, to keep his ways off human radar, placed heaven mad far from earth so our earthly sight don’t get tricked by high-level biz,  
and what if the sun is the center and the other stars, hyped by its magnetic drip and their own moves, dance around in various rounds—wandering high, then low, then ghostin’, in six modes you peep—what if the steadfast planet earth is secretly rockin’ three different motion memes, or you gotta chalk up several spheres movin’ against thwart obliquities, or maybe the sun saves its labor and that swift nocturnal/diurnal rhomb (supposedly, a wheel of day and night that you don’t even need to believe in) runs the show while earth, all industrious herself, drags day eastward and meets night on the flip with her other half still lit by his ray,  
so what if that light, sent through the wide, clear air to the terrestrial moon, shines like a mini star, lighting her by day as she does by night in a full-cycle, reciprocal flex—if land’s there with fields and peeps, her spots show up like clouds that might rain, dropping fruits in her soft soil for some to munch, and maybe other suns with their sidekick moons drop by, communicating that male and female light like a genderfluid energy that animates the whole world, stored in each orb with extra life juice,  
for such vast space in nature remains unbossed, straight up epic and free. 

by livin' soul, all desart and desolate, deadass flexin' in that void vibe,  
only to shine like a neon drip, yet barely clout to contribute, no cap,  
each orb got that lit glow flex, caught in 4k from way out there,  
down to dis hab zone that yeets that light back like a retro boomerang, deadass,  
glow back to 'em is straight-up obvious, no debate fr fr.

but yo, whether all dis is on the real or just cap;  
whether the sun, the ultimate boss in hella heaven,  
is risin' on the earth or the earth just risin' on the sun like a glitchy yeet,  
he, comin' out the east, starts his flaming drip road like a straight-up gigachad,  
or maybe a queen from the west ghostin’ her silent cruise advance,  
with a chill AF pace, spinnin' sleep mode on her soft axle while she vibes even,  
and carries you smooth on that fresh air ride, lowkey and lit.

dont overclock ur brain with secret tea, bruh;  
just bounce those thoughts to god above, serve him and respect that fear,  
while he be divvyin’ out his fav vibes on all other mobs wherever—  
yo, be stoked for what he drops, this straight-up paradise  
and ur bae eve too; heaven’s too high-key sus for u to peep what’s poppin' there,  
so stay low, be wise, only think ‘bout ur own drip, ur own being;  
dont daydream ‘bout far-out worlds or which npcs be livin’,  
in what state, mood, or level they lurkin’ in;  
chill that the deets revealed are not just earth tea, but also that exclusive heavenly drip.

so then adam, cleared of all that sus doubt, clapped back,  
“yo, u satisfied me mad, pure heavenly brainiac, zen angel vibes, on god!”  
and, free of cray complexities, taught me the easiest livin’ hack;  
no messy AF thoughts to interrupt the sweet sauce of life,  
from which god straight-up told us to ghost all anxious drama,  
and not mess with our chill—unless we go wanderin’ deep in vain thoughts.  

but our mind’s way too apt to rove unchecked, no chill on that endless roam;  
until some savage warn or real-life yeet teaches it  
that it ain’t about knowin’ the far-out, obscure, subtle tea;  
it’s all about peepin’ that daily drip, the prime wisdom,  
‘cause extra stuff is just hot fume, void vibes, or lowkey bold audacity,  
leavin’ us as total noobs in the things that truly matter, always scramblin’ to search.

so yo, from this high-key pitch, let’s yeet down a lower flight,  
droppin’ some real useful, at-hand tea; maybe then,  
by pure sufferance and ur usual lit favour, something unseasonable might pop off.

i heard u spill what went down before my memory was even woke—  
now, listen up as i spill my saga, bet u ain’t heard dis yet;  
and since the day’s still lit, peep how i trap u in my subtle drip,  
invitin’ u to vibe while i relays, kinda fondly hopin’ for ur clapback,  
‘cause while chillin’ with u, i’m feelin’ like i’m in heaven,  
and ur sweet chat is way sweeter than those bomb palm fruits  
that quench a hangry vibe after savage hustle—  
they fill u quick, but ur divine-dipped words never hit that full satiety, deadass.

so then raphael, all chill and heavenly meek, dropped his lowkey reply,  
“yo, ur lips r never sus, sire of humans, and ur tongue’s straight fire;  
god poured his gifts on u like a tidal wave, inside and out, legit,  
whether u spit or are silent, pure glam follows u; every move, every word,  
attends perfection—  
we in heaven got mad props for u on earth too, just like our homie-servant,  
all while namin’ and chattin’ about god’s ways with man, no cap.”

‘cause god, on the real, honored u and set man on a vibe of equal love:  
so spill it, since i was ghostin’ that day, off on a wild, sketch voyage  
to hell’s sketchy gates, rollin’ deep in full legion (yep, our orders were wild),  
to make sure no sneaky spy or enemy slid out while god was in his work,  
lest some incensed troll mix up creation with destruction in a cringey meltdown,  
ya feel?  
not that they dared flex without his permission—nah,  
but he sends us on his high-key orders like a sovran king,  
demandin’ our prompt obedience.  
we were fast, doors slammed shut, gates locked down like a boss;  
then, before we even vibed through, we heard noise that wasn’t a dance  
or chill song—pure torment, loud lament, and furious rage droppin’ mad heat.

thank fuck we yeeted back to the coasts of light before sabbath-evening,  
‘cause we had it all in charge, deadass.

now drop ur relation, ‘cause i’m all ears,  
pleased with ur words as much as u are with mine.  
so spake the godlike power, and thus our sire did his epic drop.

for real, man, explainin’ how human life kicked off is mad hard;  
like who even knew from the get-go that cravin’ to chat with u forever  
would hit me so hard, on god;  
as soon as i leveled up from the deepest sleep, all soft on that flowery herb,  
i found myself laid out, drippin’ in balmy sweat,  
then the sun yeeted his beams to dry up all that reekin’ moisture, legit.

straight up, my eyes yeeted toward heaven, starin’ mad at that ample sky,  
‘til, outta a wild instinct, i jumped up like a turbo glitch,  
standin’ all upright, ready to vibe;  
around me, i peeped hills, valleys, shady woods, and sunny plains,  
plus liquid streams murmurin’ as they flowed,  
and creatures livin’, movin’, walkin’, or straight up flyin’—birds warblin’ on branches,  
everything was smilin’ like a million memes,  
and my heart was overflowin’ with that fresh fragrance and pure joy.

then i peeped myself, scanned every single limb,  
sometimes cruisin’, sometimes sprintin’ with supple joints,  
all led by that lively, uncontainable vigor;  
but damn, who i was, where i even came from, or why—i had no clue;  
so i tried spittin’ some words, and my tongue just obeyed,  
name-droppin’ every wild detail i peeped;  
“yo sun, u da fair light,” i said,  
“and u, enlightened earth, so fresh and lit,  
yo hills, valleys, rivers, woods, plains,  
and every single movin’, livin’ creature—tell me,  
if u peeped, how i even yeeted here?  
not from myself, but by some mega maker dude,  
who’s the ultimate OG in goodness and power—  
tell me, how can i know him, how to adore him,  
since i move, live, and feel hella happy ‘cause of his drip?”

while i was hollerin’ and wanderin’ clueless ‘bout whither i was driftin’,  
from where i first sucked in air and peeped that happy light,  
no one hit me back, so i crashed on a green, shady bank  
bursted with flowers, gettin’ all pensive,  
then gentle sleep slid in, grabbin’ my droused sense,  
all unbothered though i thought i was droppin’ back to my old noob state, ready to dissolve, on god.

then, outta nowhere, a wild dream stood over my dome,  
its inner ghost vibe pushin’ my fancy to believe i still had that being energy,  
that i was still livin’. one figure, lookin’ all divine, rolled up and said,  
“yo, ur mansion needz u, adam; rise up, first man,  
the original dad of billions, summoned as the guide  
to the garden of bliss, where ur throne is all prepped.”  
with that, he grabbed my hand and yeeted me smoothly  
over fields and waters, floatin’ like a ghost in the air,  
until he landed me on a woody mountain—its top a wide, lit circle,  
lined with the dopest trees, with chill walkways and hang zones;  
maad, what i peeped on earth before was straight-up bland in comparison.

each tree was loaded with the freshest, fairest fruit hangin’ like eye-candy,  
temptin’ me to yeet up and munch down quick,  
so i woke up and found every damn detail real,  
like the dream had only dropped its lively shadow—  
this was the start of a new wander,  
until my guide popped up from among the trees, pure presence divine.  
rejoicin’, but shook in mad awe,  
i fell at his divine feet all submiss and lowkey,  
he then boosted me up and said in a smooth tone,  
“whom thou soughtest i am, the author of all this lit drip u peep above,  
around u, and beneath—this paradise is all yours,  
claim it as ur own turf to till, guard, and yeet up that fruit:  
for every tree grewin’ in the garden, munch freely with a glad heart;  
don’t fear no shortage here—  
but that one tree, whose fruit brings the knowledge of good and bad,  
i set as the test of ur loyalty and faith, right in the middle by the tree of life:  
remember my warn, shun that bitter taste, and dodge its harsh aftermath;  
’cause the day u munch it, u break my sole command,  
and deadass, u’re doomed to become mortal—  
from that moment, this dope vibe is lost,  
and u get booted out to a world full of woe and endless sorrow.”  
he dropped that rigid ban, sternly, so it still echoes damn near dread in my ears,  
even though i wasn’t tryna catch that burn; but soon his clear vibes returned,  
and his gracious purpose got refreshed, no cap.

“not only these lit bounds, but the whole damn earth i hand over to u and ur squad;  
rule it like absolute lords—every living thing in it,  
whether on land, in the sea, or floatin’ in the air;  
beast, fish, and fowl alike. as a sign, every bird and beast  
will roll up two by two, humbly comin’ at u;  
i bring ‘em to get their names from u, and they’ll pay u fealty with total subservience;  
even the fish chillin’ in their watery pad ain’t summoned here,  
’cause they can’t ditch their element to breathe that thinner air, yo.”

as he dropped that epic order, every bird and beast came cruisin’ two by two,  
all lowkey bowin’ down with bland vibes; every bird dipped its wing in respect.  
i named ‘em as they rolled by, catchin’ the vibe of god’s knowledge  
that filled my sudden brain blast;  
but damn, in these vibes, i still didn’t peep what i craved deep down—  
so i leaned into that heavenly vision even more.

oh snap, by what name—cuz u, above all these,  
beyond mankind or any higher squad,  
totally outshine my naming game;  
how can i adore u, the author of this entire universe,  
and all the dope goodness dropped on man?  
u provided all things so lavishly, hands wide open,  
but i don’t even see who’s vibin’ with u; in solitude,  
what’s happiness if u can’t share it, or if even together, the contentment just ain’t there?

i got all presumptive, and the bright vision, smilin’ with extra glow,  
shot back, “what u call solitude? ain’t the earth packed with endless livin’ creatures,  
and the air refillin’ at ur command, all ready to roll and play around u?  
don’t u know their lingo and their wild ways? they got brains too, legits,  
findin’ their own pastime and runnin’ the show; ur realm is mad huge.”  
so then the universal lord, dropin’ order like a boss, looked stern,  
and i, with mad respect and humble vibes, replied,  
“let not my words offend thee, heavenly power;”

my maker yo, be hella chill while i drop these wild fire bars, deadass spittin’ raw truth so bless up my mic right now  
yo, did you even set me up as your literal standin’ in this realm, like a legit substitute, or nah?  
and these wannabe inferiors be straight posted below me like noobs, fr fr  
among a bunch of scrubs that ain’t even on the same level, what kinda squad even sorts out real vibes, what kinda harmony or legit delight even exists?  
it’s gotta be that mutual drip, proportional flex and all that jazz – given and received, on the real, not that uneven glitch where one’s mega lit and the other is dead ass slack,  
‘cause when you mix one intense vibe with one low-key remiss flop, they just don’t sync, turning into a snooze fest real quick, both boring as heck  
talkin’ ‘bout fellowship is like chasin’ that squad energy i crave, you know, the kind that’s down for all that rational delight while the brute can’t even roll with the real human clan – they be vibin’ only with their own, like lion chillin’ with lioness  
yo, you paired em up like perfect insta duos, whereas a bird trying to link up with a beast or a fish tryna chat with a fowl? nah fam, that convo just ain’t it,  
and don’t even get me started on an ox tryna bond with an ape – major cringe, and man with beast? that’s the ultimate cap, son  
and then the almighty dropped his divine clapback like “i gotchu, no cap, not even a bit heated”  

yo so check this out: a subtle, lowkey kind-of-happy vibe you be promising for yourself, adam – you choosin’ your squad like a pro, but deadass you’re doomed to solo pleasure, even if that pleasure’s super extra on its own,  
so what’s the tea on me and my current state, huh? do i look like i’m packin’ that full-on happiness drip or nah? like, here i am, eternally flying solo, a total lone wolf from forever, ‘cause i don’t peep any second self or any equal level whatsoever, major yikes  
like, how’m i even supposed to vibe and chat if my only crew is made up of the creatures i spawned and those infinite lower-tier minions spiralin’ below, unable to reach the extra levels of your elite crew?  

he dipped out real quick and i, all humble and low-key, responded – i’m tryna hit that high and deep eternal flex, but all human brainpower gets clapped, supreme vibes and all that,  
‘cause you, my dude, are programmed perfect with zero glitches, while man’s just got degree-level deficits; his craving is powered by choppin’ it up with his own copy to patch up his fails or give him that solace for his epic lmfao defects  
listen, there’s zero need for you to clone yourself, you’re already infinite – like a one in a sea of absolute ones – but man, when numbered, just shows his one cringey flaw, replicating himself and creating a mini glitch in unity that’s so defective it screams for extra backup love and super tight amity  
even if you roll solo and vibin’ with yourself, you ain’t about that loud social chatter; but yo, with that mad vibe, you can level up your creation to any union or communion status you want – king-level deification and all that,  
me? when i try to chit-chat with that creation, it just stays stuck on basic mode; i can’t find any proper chill or comfy vibe in how they’re wired  

so, i went all in and dropped my raw, emboldened truth, using that sweet, freedom-fueled, permissive sauce that got me mad acceptance – and boom, the gracious divine voice hit me back with that epic approval,  
up to that point, trying you out, adam, had me legit hyped; i peeped that you weren’t just hangin’ with the beasts (which you named on point) but also with your own inner flex, lettin’ your spirit fly free – my own blueprint wasn’t handed off to the crude ones, and that squad of theirs was totally not your vibe, so yo, you should lowkey ghost ‘em forever and keep it one hundred  
i knew, even before you voiced it, that it wasn’t cool for man to be left solo, and none of that other basic crew you peeped was meant for you – it was all just a test to see if you could judge what was squad goals and what wasn’t: so next up, i promised to deliver your mirror image, your ride-or-die help, your other self exactly to match your heart’s wildest desire  

then he bailed, or at least i didn’t catch no more – my mortal self got totally overpowered by his hella heavenly vibes, crushing the long-standing weight under which it had been saggin’, and it strained to reach that mad height in our cosmic, celestial convo so sublime it was like starstruck senses gettin’ dazzled and burned out, then totally crashed, needing that sleep reboot call from nature which came quick as a dab, shutting my eyes like “later fam”  

my eyes got zapped closed while still leakin’ that inner creative cell – my internal sight still rockin’ some abstract, trance-mode visuals – i swear, even in a deep sleep state i peeped where i crashed and saw a dope form, still glowin’ and lit like a legendary boss before whom i stood wide awake  
this mythical figure leaned down, opened up my left side like a secret drop, and snatched a rib like it was prime loot – poured in warm, cordial spirit vibes and fresh life-blood streaming in like epic refill, the wound wide open but then glitched back to flesh and healed in a blink  
straight up, he molded and crafted that rib with his own hands; and from the magic underneath his creative touch, a new creature popped up, human-like but with a diff sex twist, so damn gorge and lit that what was once the world’s peak beauty now made every other look meh,  
she summed up perfection in her vibe and aesthetics – and from that moment, she infused my heart with a sweetness i’d never peeped before, droppin’ love and wild, amorous delight vibes into every corner of my world  

then she ghosted out, leavin’ me in the dark; i woke up on a mad quest to find her or else be condemned to forever bemoan her loss and cancel every other pleasure for good  
and when i was down in the dumps, outta hope and all, boom, there she was not far off, just as i peeped her in my dream – decked out in all the fly drip that earth or heaven could ever flex to make her super amiable  
she rolled in, led by her unseen heavenly maker and guided by his divine voice – and she wasn’t clueless about that nuptial sanctity and wedding ritual vibes, nah, she was all over it  
every step she took was grace incarnate, with heaven itself glimmerin’ in her eye and each move oozin’ dignity and love  
i was so overjoyed i couldn’t even hold it in – my voice burst out loud, a full-on shout of pure hype  
this crazy twist made everything click; you, creator, mad bountiful and chill, fulfilled your word – the giver of all that’s dope – and honestly the flyest gift of all was this masterpiece of a gift, and i ain’t even jelly; now i peep my own bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, literally me standin’ here: woman, that’s her name, crafted from man so original that he’d ditch his own folks to vibe solely with his wife,  
and together they become that epic one-unit squad: one flesh, one heart, one soul, united in glitch-free harmony  

she caught my vibe all right; even though she was divinely summoned, she still rocked that virgin innocence and modesty – her virtue and inner worth, the kind that needs to be wooed the right way rather than snatched up in a clout chase – not obvious or in-your-face but lowkey, under-the-radar exclusive, making her all the more fire and desirable  
or to break it down, nature itself, pure with no sinful static, designed her so perfectly that when she saw me, she pivoted in awe  
i slid right after her; she, with all the honor and big respectful majesty, gave a nod to my earnest, pleading reason  
i then led her to the nuptial bower, her cheeks flaring up like the blush of a fresh morn, while all of heaven and the dopest constellations beaming their choicest vibes at that very hour  
the whole earth threw down a major congratulatory flex, every hill joined in, birds got all stoked, fresh breezes and soft airs whispered the news through the woods, wings launching roses and spicy shrub scents left and right, all in a wild, playful display until even the amorous nocturnal bird belted out spousal jams and told the evening star to hustle up on his hilltop to fire up that bridal lamp  

so now i’ve spilled all my state, laid out my story of that earthly bliss i’m riding, truth be told – and i gotta confess, i peep delight in other things too, but they’re like side snacks that don’t really morph your mind or spark that mad, fierce desire; i’m talkin’ tastes, sights, smells, herbs, fruits, flowers, chill walks, and the vibey tunes of birds – but here, nah, this is a whole different level of transported touch, the ultimate first spark of passion, a wild commotion that no other vibe can match – all other enjoyments be like basic background noise next to the powerhouse charm of beauty’s intense glance  
maybe nature was a bit extra and left some parts underproof to hold that object of desire, or maybe she, lowkey subtracting some of my drip, over-dosed on outer ornamentation so elaborate that the inner vibe came out a bit meh  
i get it though, in nature’s prime hustle, the inferior part she wired is all about the mind’s inner throne that totally flexes, while the outer show barely mirrors his maker’s image and falls short of expressing that whole dominion vibe over the rest of the creatures  
but when i roll up close to her pure loveliness, damn, she be absolute, complete in herself, so on point that whatever she decides to say or do comes off as the wisest, most virtuous, slickest, and best move ever – all that higher knowledge in her presence gets totally trashed, and even wisdom, when dishing it out with her, comes off as goofy as pure folly  
authority and reason? they just chill on standby for her, like pre-installed, not some afterthought, and to seal the deal, the epic heights of mind and nobility set up their base in her loveliest self, building an aura so awe-inspiring like a guardian angel on guard duty – and then the angel, with that super tight, contracted brow, be like,  

yo, don’t come at nature like she slacked – she did her part, so you gotta handle yours and don’t be all diffident about wisdom; she ain’t ghostin’ you if you don’t ditch her right when you need that lit vibe close, by over-hyping the less excellent lowkey trash you see around you  
’cause like, what gets you admiring, what blows your mind – that external drip? sure, it’s fair and worthy of mad love and honor, but don’t let it turn into a full-on subjugation; weigh yourself with her, then check your own worth – often, nothing boosts you more than that self-esteem grind built on just, proper, well-managed hustle; the more you master that, the more she’ll crown you as her top dog and yield all her real drops,  
decked out so extra for your delight that with pure honor you can love your mate, who peeps your vibe even when you’re rockin’ a low-key “i got no clue” mode  
but if that touch vibe – the very thing that spreads mankind – is the ultimate, mad precious delight above all else, then know it’s the same drop that doles out to cattle and every beast, which they wouldn’t even get if it wasn’t dope enough to dominate a man’s soul or ignite his passion  

what’s higher in her squad that you peep? it’s that attractive, human, rational, pure love energy – in lovin’ you’re solid, but in wild passion, nah, ‘cause true love ain’t just raw passion; love smooths out your thoughts and expands your heart, sittin’ in reason with mad judicious vibes; it’s the scale that lets you ascend to heavenly love without gettin’ sunk in basic carnal feels – and that’s exactly why no beastly match could ever be found for you  
to which, half abashed and vibin’ in his retro cringe, adam clapped back  

“yo, it ain’t just that your outer drip is on fleek, nor is it any generic procreation vibe that all these kinds be spittin’ (although i gotta say, you’re top-tier on that cozy, genial bed game, and i’m lowkey in awe of it),  
what really slaps me are those graceful moves, those thousand tiny decencies dripping daily from your words and actions mixed with mad love and that sweet, smooth compliance that shouts out genuine mind-meld – like, a union of minds or even one soul split into two; a wedded harmony that’s more bomb than any insta-filtered sound  
but yo, i ain’t about to just spill the surface – i gotta drop what i feel deep down inside, not messed up by external static, as i peep a crazy range of objects through my senses, each reppin’ its own vibe, yet all while stayin’ free as heck”

approve the best, deadass, and follow what i hype up, no cap  
to love, yo, dont roast me over that, cuz love be the jetpack up to heaven, the ultimate way n guide, on god fr fr  
so chill with me if it’s all law-approved, ya dig—  
dont go lovin’ those heavenly spirit squad, and like, how they flex their love? is it just a fire look? or do they mix that irradiance, virtual glow, or an irl touch-up?  
to whom the angel, rockin’ a smile that be lit like celestial rosso drip, love’s true hue, shot back that vibe, lettin’ it be known we all vibin’ happy, cuz without that heart, happiness is straight-up ghost mode  
whatever pure juice you snag in your bod (and btw you were born pure flex) we level up in supreme mode, with not a barrier in membrane, joint, or limb stoppin’ the flow, like air vibin’ with air when them spirit homies embrace  
total blend, pure union of pure with pure, no extra drag of restrained flow, just flesh mixin’ with flesh, soul with soul, sick collab, deadass  
but yo, im done here; the parting sun be yeetin’ past earth’s green cape n chill isles where hesperian rays set, my signal to dip out, fr  
stay savage, live lit, and love hard! but first, love that dude whose love means obeyin’ his major orders; lowkey don’t let wild passion mess your head up into doin’ stuff free will would never even admit, ya feel?  
yo, your vibe n that of all your sons, the whole weal n woe is on you, so watch it, fam!  
i’ll be hyped on your grind, rejoicing in your persevering, and all the blest crew too—stand fast; whether you rise or yeet, it’s all on your own free-skrrt vibe, deadass  
if you’re pure within, you need zero extra assists, and you ghost any sus temptations tryin’ to drag you down  
so he bounced up, and little adam followed with mad benedictions—“peace out, heavenly guest, ethereal messenger,” cried adam, as he yeeted, “go on, heavenly homie, since your sovereign goodness is straight fire!”  
yo, your chill, affable vibe has been mad gentle on me, and forever i’ll remember that, so keep bein’ good n slide back to us, aight?  
they split up; the angel yeeted up to heaven from that thick shadow, and adam dipped back to his crib

book ix

yo, no more of that chill convo where god or angel vibes kick hang with man like bestie homies—just full-on buffet style rural repast convos, lettin’ him drop venial talk like it’s all good; now i gotta flip these notes to tragik mode—mad distrust, foul breach, disloyal revolt on man’s turf and straight-up disobedience, while heaven’s crew be all ghosted, distant, extra spicy with anger and legit clapbacks, droppin’ judgements that birthed a world of mega woe, sin and death’s shadow, misery’s grim hype—sad af task, yet the drama is even more heroick than stern achilles goin’ off on his foe, thrice dodging around troy’s wall, or turnus eruptin’ over lavinia lost, or neptune’s lava, or juno’s flame that had the greek squad confused, plus cytherea’s boy all tangled in rage  
if i can snag a style that’s answerable from my celestial patroness—who slides in nightly, no beggin’, dictating while im catchin’ z’s, or droppin’ inspo for my off-the-cuff verse—  
since day one this epic vibe for heroick song had me vibin’, choosin’ it slow ‘n startin’ late; i ain’t exactly a grindsta for scribblin’ war rants, which used to be the only hype to flex hero style dissectin’ epic knights in bogus battles, deadass  
talkin’ bout that next-level patience and unsung hero martyr vibes; or droppin’ deets on races and games, or even tiltin’ like furniture jousts with emblazoned shields, quirky caparisons n rides, bases n tinsel bling, gorgeous knights throwin’ down in jousts and tourneys; then big-ass feasts rolled out in halls with crew and seneschals—meanwhile, that lame artifice or office hustle ain’t what justly crowns heroick names for dudes or poems, ya feel?  
me, tho, ain’t that skillful or bookish, so i got a higher argument left—enough on its own to raise that name, unless im too late in the game, or stuck in a cold vibe, or the years mess up my wings, deadass; and they might if it’s all mine, not hers, who vibes into my ear every night with that drip  
the sun dipped out, and then the star of hesperus slid in, whose job is to drop that twilight mood on the earth—a short arbiter between day and night—and now the whole night hemisphere had cloaked the horizon, big yikes  
so then satan, who lowkey yeeted outta eden ‘cause gabriel was throwin’ threat vibes, got into deep fraud n malice mode, all about wreckin’ mankind, even if it was extra heavy on him, fearless as ever, dipped by night and slid back at midnight round the globe; all stealth, ‘cause uriel, sun regent, peeped his entrance and gave a heads up to the cherub squad on duty, legit  
then, all full of inner anguish, he cruised for seven straight nights in darkness; circled that equinoctial line three times; four times slid across the car of night from pole to pole, scopin’ every colure vibe; on the eighth he bounced back, and on some coast away from cherubic radar, by mad stealth, found an unsuspected route  
yo, there used to be this spot, now ghost, since sin—nah, not even time—flipped the script, where the tigris, posted at the foot of paradise, got yeeted underground into a gulf, ‘til a fountain popped up by the tree of life, wild energy, deadass  
so the river dipped in, and with it, satan popped up, wrapped in rising mist vibes; then he went searchin’ for a sick hideout—scannin’ the sea and the land, from eden over pontus n the maeo-tis pool, way past the river ob; slid downward as far as antarctick, and long stretch from orontes west to the ocean blocked at darien; then cruised to where the ganges n indus flow heavy, no cap  
thus the orb he roamed with mad narrow search, and after deep inspection of every creature to peep which one could best serve his scam, he found that the serpent was the sneakiest beast in the whole field, lol  
after a long-ass debate and swirlin’ thoughts, he finally picked that serpent as the ultimate vessel, the fittest imp of fraud, for slidin’ in his dark schematics away from prying eyes—‘cause in that sly snake, all his shady moves went off without suspicion, straight from his own native subtlety, unlike any other beast which might scream diabolick power, way beyond basic brute feels  
so he resolved, but first let his inward grief burst out in a mad vent of plaints, raw feelings pourin’ out  
and like, on the real, a seat more worthy than what the gods built—second-thought remix of the old vibe! oh earth, you be almost like heaven, if not the prime pick for what god, after leveling up from better to worse, would build, fr  
terrestrial heaven, dancin’ round with other heavens that shine, yet rock their flashy, officious lamps, light on light, just for you, concentratin’ all those sacred beams of influence—like god in heaven is the center but still spreads mad vibes to all; so you, by centering, receive from all those orbs: in you, not in themselves, all that known virtue pops off in herbs, plants, and the next-level creation of living creatures, growing, sensing, reasoning—all summed up in man, deadass  
imagine the delight i’d have strollin’ your vibe around if i could revel in any sweet interchange of hills n valleys, rivers, woods n plains—land then sea with shores crowned in forests, rocks, dens, n caves, straight up epic—but i can’t find no chill spot or refuge in any of that, and the more i peep these pleasures, the deeper my torment hits, like an endless siege of opposites: any good vibe turns into pure bane, and chillin’ in heaven would be even more sus for my state, fr  
but i ain’t tryna live here or in heaven unless i can boss heaven’s supreme, no cap; and i ain’t hopin’ to feel any less miserable by what i chase, but rather drag others into this mess too—even if it backfires and makes my vibe worse, ya feel?  
cuz only by wreckin’ stuff do i catch a break from these relentless thoughts; and whether i destroy him or flip him to a total loss, for whom all this chaos was made, everything’s gonna bounce back as fate linked in weal or woe—with woe then, so that destruction spreads wide, givin’ me the sole infernal glory in one day to have marred what he, almighty, styled by grindin’ six nights and days, kept on makin’; and who even knows how long he had been scheming? maybe not longer than that one night when i yeeted nearly half the angelic rep from servitude, leavin’ a thinner crowd of his adorers, deadass  
and so, to get his revenge and patch up his messed-up squad, whether the old spent virtue failed to create more angels (if they were even his) or, to roast us even more, he decided to shove into our space a creature molded from earth and leveled him up, rising from such basic origins with heavenly spoils—our spoils too—what he decreed got done; man was made, and for that dude he built this dope world, earth his crib, crowned him lord; and, oh pure indignity, forced angel-wings and flaming ministers to guard his turf on earth—with that creepy vigilance i seriously dread; so to ghost it, i wrapped myself in a midnight mist, glidin’ all obscure, pryin’ in every bush or brake where i might snag the serpent nappin’—to hide me and the dark intent i roll in, fr  
yo, damn foul descent! that i, who once flexed with gods to sit at the very top, am now forced into bein’ a straight-up beast; mixed in with gross bestial slime, incarnated into this wretched form, all while i still aspired to hit deity levels, lol  
but like, what will ambition and revenge not stoop to? whoever aspires must go as low as the heights they soared, no cap—massively obnoxious, whether first or last, gettin’ down to the basest vibes. revenge, though sweet at first, turns bitter real quick and boomerangs on itself—so let it be, i don’t care, so long as it lands right on the next dude who sparks my envy, this new fav of heaven, this man of clay, son of pure spite, raised from dust by his maker just to roast us more—spite repaid with spite, best served, deadass  
so spittin’ that, through every dank or dry thicket like a low-creepin’ black mist, he kept on with his midnight hunt, searchin’ for that serpent; and soon enough he peeped that dude fast-sleepin’ in a self-rolled labyrinth, his head at the center, stacked with all them subtle wiles, lit af  
not yet chillin’ in some horrid shady spot or dismal den, nor even nocent; but, on the grassy herb,  
…

yo, fearless unfeared, he was straight-up snoozin, mouth wide like he was about to yeet sleep in full-on giga chad mode, deadass  
then, like, the devil slid in all sneaky and raw, droppin’ brutal vibes like no cap, invading his heart and head with that next-level possessive inspo—acting all smart af while catchin’ zzz’s, not even bothered, just chillin’ and waitin’ for that morn drip  

so when the sacred sunrise began to flex its light over eden, those dank humid flowers were breathin’ that morning incense like straight-up aesthetic legends, while every livin’ thing, yeah, literally breathin’, sent silent praise up from earth’s massive altar, fillin’ the creator’s nostrils with that grateful aroma, no lie  
and boom—the human duo rolled up, joinin’ their vocal worship with the squad of soundless creatures, all vibin’ together under the prime season for the sweetest scents and airs, lit beyond belief  

then they kicked it off, chattin’ about how to smash their ever-growin’ grind, ‘cause their hustle had totally outgrown the two-hand gardening flex, and eve was like, “yo hubby, let’s get it,” droppin’ the starter pack for that ultimate duo plot  

adam was all up in it, sayin’, “bruh, we still gotta dress this garden, tend them plants, herbs, and flowers like it’s our pleasant, appointed quest,” but until more hands came thru, the work just kept levelin’ up on its own—luxurious by lowkey restraint, where by day we’d lop, prune, prop, or bind that wild overgrowth, and then after a night or two, the unruly growth would just roast us for lettin’ it be wild, smh  
so, advise me now or peep my first brain blast: let’s split this hustle—you handle whatever choice or need, whether windin’ that woodbine ‘round the arbour or directin’ the ivy clingin’ up for a glow-up—while i dip into the spring of roses, mixed with myrtle, to fix up biz till noon, ya feel?  

cause, like, when we stick so close all day, our grind might get hit with random looks, smiles, or new chat that totally derails our work—even if we start early and supper just drops unearned, big yikes, right?  
adam, keepin’ it mild, shot back, “yo, i gotchu.”  

hey, sole eve—my one and only ride or die, no creature compares to you, dear, on every level! you motioned like a boss and your brain’s lit on point about crushin’ this given work from god himself; not a single fire compliment skipped, ’cause nothing in a woman is more fire than studyin’ perfect household vibes and boostin’ her hubby’s rep, deadass  

but yo, our lord ain’t tryna harsh our vibe with too strict a toil—he left room for chill breaks whether for grub or deep convo, food for the brain or this sweet, look-born, smile-spillin’ link that flows from reason (which, if denied to the brute, is love’s true fuel, right?)—love ain’t the lowest grind, it’s made for delight, and delight’s teamed up with reason, legit  

no cap, these paths and secret hangouts got our joint hands ready to ghost the wilderness as wide as our flex can walk, till the young squad rolls in to assist; but if all that chatter fills you up, i can dip for a hot sec—’cause sometimes solitude’s the best society, and a short retreat just hypes the ultimate return, on god  

but yo, real talk—i’m caught starin’ at the thought that harm might sever you from me, ‘cause you know the warnings about that shady, malicious foe—jealous of our epic happiness and drowning in his own despair—tryna hit us with woe and shame via a sly, covert assault, always lurkin’ nearby with greedy eyes, hopin’ to snag his clout by tearin’ us apart, even though we’re squad goals, always ready to lend a rapid assist  
whether his first hustle is to knock our fealty from god or mess with that conjugal love—which, tbh, makes him extra jelly—or even worse, ditch the faithful one who gave you life and still shields you, deadass  

yo, when danger or dishonor’s lurkin’, the wifey sticks by her hubby—the ultimate bodyguard, ridin’ out the worst alongside her—and then the virgin majesty of eve, all lovin’ despite gettin’ hit with some unkind vibes, drops her sweet, austere, chill response, no cap  

offspring of heaven and earth, and literally all earth’s lord, listen up: we got this enemy out here lookin’ to wreck us, as you just clued me in and i even caught whispers from that partin’ angel while chillin’ in a shady nook at the close of the evening flower show, omg  
but if you’re ever trippin’ and doubt my rock-solid firmness toward god or you ‘cause our foe’s temptin’ vibes might try to shake us—i ain’t about to hear that noise. his violence? nah, you don’t fear it ‘cause we’re built like gods, not built for death or pain—we either don’t even catch his lame hits or we yeet ‘em right back, no cap  

so if his shady fraud has you shook, that just means you’re equally afraid that my unbreakable faith and love could get jacked by his scam, like your own chest is buzzin’ with doubts—adam, you think her vibes are too extra for you? and adam hit back with those healing words, smooth like a midnight stream  

daughter of god and man, immortal eve, that’s totally you—complete, sin-free, and beyond blame; i ain’t tryna diss your presence, but to dodge the sneaky attempt our foe is setting up, fr fr  
cuz whoever tempts, even if in vain, at least throws down some filthy dishonor, implying you ain’t unbreakable in faith or immune to temptation; you’d react with major scorn and hot anger to any offered wrong—even if it falls flat—so don’t sleep on it if i’m hustlin’ to block that shade just for you, ‘cause our enemy, as bold as he might seem, won’t dare hit both of us at once, or if he does, he’s gotta slam the attack on me first, ya dig?  

and yo, don’t just dismiss his malice and fake guile—dude’s gotta be mad subtle if he can seduce angels, and don’t think gettin’ extra help from others is a waste. i, catchin’ all the vibe from your killer looks, score access to every virtue—you're way wiser, more woke, and extra strong if you need that outer muscle; and if you even glance at shame, it’ll boost our vibes to max level, uniting all our fire energy, deadass  

why wouldn’t you feel that inner realness when i’m in the mix, and choose to face your trial with me—the top witness to your tried-and-true virtue? so domestick adam, all about care and matrimonial love, dropped that deep line; but eve, thinkin’ her faith wasn’t given enough credit, hit back with that sweet remix reply, accent on point, like, “yep.”  

if this is our sitch, livin’ trapped in a narrow loop caused by some foe—be it subtle or savage—we ain’t rocking that same defense all alone, so how the heck are we supposed to be happy, always sweatin’ fear of harm?  
but hear me out: harm don’t come before sin—our foe just throws cheap shade at our integrity, but his trash esteem boomerangs right back on him, so why would we shun or fear him when we’d rather score double honor from his busted game? find that inner peace and collect some heavenly favours as our witness, no cap  

and like, what’s faith, love, virtue if they ain’t been put to the test, standin’ solo without external boost? don’t go suspectin’ our happy state just ‘cause the maker left it a bit raw—whether on our own or as a squad, our happiness isn’t frail unless eden itself is exposed as a fake setup, big yikes  
and so adam, fired up, hit back hard  

o woman, everything is best as god’s will—his creatin’ hand left nothin’ half-baked or deficient, especially not man or anything that could lock down his happy state, secure from outside beef; the real danger lies within himself, but he’s got the power, so against his own will, no harm comes through, deadass  

but god left us free will—what vibes with reason is free, and he made reason all right, only warnin’ her to stay woke and upright, ‘cause if some pretty good-lookin’ trap surprises her, she might dish out false orders and mess up the will, makin’ it do what god straight-up forbid, no cap  

so instead of mistrust, tender love is the move—i should keep a close eye on you, and you on me; we’re firm but can swerve ‘cause reason might get snared by some specious offer kicked by that foe, fallin’ into deception if she slackens on watch, even though she was warned, smh  
so, don’t chase temptation—avoidin’ it is way better, especially if you stick with me; trials will hit outta nowhere, no cap  

if you wanna prove your constancy, first back up your obedience—let the silent observers who haven’t seen you get tested vouch for it; but if you reckon that an unsought trial might actually make us safer than all this hype, then bounce; ‘cause your stayin’ ain’t free and only holds you back—roll in your native innocence, lean on your solid virtue, and summon every bit of that inner fire! god did his part, so do yours, fam  

so dropped the patriarch adam with that savage sermon; but eve, still lowkey submissive yet persistin’, hit back in her own style, sayin’, “with your permission and all that deep warnin’ from your last brain blast—just so our trial, when it pops off unexpectedly, finds us both maybe less prepped—I’m bouncin’, and i don’t really expect a foe so proud to target the weaker one first; the more he’s bent on this, the more shame will yeet his weak repulse, fr fr.”  

so sayin’ that, she gently withdrew her hand from her hubby’s grip and, light as a wood-nymph, oread or dryad or straight outta delia’s squad, bounced off to the groves; but delia herself, strutting like a goddess—though not armed with bow and quiver but rockin’ raw, rude gardening tools (guiltless of fire, crafted or even angel-dropped)—was lookin’ hella on point  
decked out like pales or pomona, she was the ultimate vibe, like pomona when she dipped from vertumnus or even ceres in her prime, yet still carryin’ that virgin proserpina from jove energy, no cap  

her long, ardent gaze locked on his eye, full of delight but lowkey cravin’ more of her stay, ya know? often he hollered for her quick return; she kept it real, obligin’ to be back by noon in the chill bower, setting the scene for a noontide feast or smooth afternoon chill sesh, all in best order  

oh, so deceived and failing, poor hapless eve—with all that presumed return, so perverse! you never even snagged a sweet bite or solid chill in paradise from that hour; instead, a savage ambush hid among perf flowers and shady vibes waited with hellish, imminent rancor to block your way or yeet you back, stripped of innocence, faith, and bliss, big yikes!  

and now, since the first break of dawn, the fiend—just a basic serpent in appearance—slid out on his quest, prowlin’ where he could likely scoop that next lowkey victory, deadass…

yo so like, only these 2 homies of humanz, deadass, but in them the whole squad’s literally the snacc target fr fr, ya feel me? 
bro was rollin thru every bower and field, scoutin any bomb-ass tuft of grove or garden-plot that slapped extra hard cuz he was on a mad hustle for that plantation of delight vibe; by fountain drip or chill shady rivulet he was searchin all places, lowkey hopin his luck might score him eve on the solo, not expectin it but wishin hard, when boom outta nowhere—beyond his faint hope—he peeped eve, all separate and ghosted in a cloud of lit fragrance, where she was standin, half-hidden cuz the roses were flexin blush mode thick around her, glowin off like they were droppin support for each flower on some slender stalk, poppin off in colours like gay carnation, purple, azure, or even speckled with gold, all teeterin unsustained; and she, like a total chill queen, kept 'em in check with a gentle myrtle band, not even tryna care bout her own vibe, the absolute fairest unsupport flower ever, reppin her prime prop so far and storm energy nigh

then bro got closer and rolled through mad walks in the dopest covert—cedar, pine, palm, whatever—switchin up from voluble to bold, ghostin here and there in a thick weave of arborets and flowers all borderin each bank, every leaf lookin like it was eve’s own handiwork; spottin somethin’ way more scrumptious than any sham garden flex or that revived adonis drip, or even famed alcinous, laertes’ son rep, or that non-mystick vibe where some sapient king was gettin his fling on with a fly egyptian bae. yo he was mad vibin with the scene—the place was cool but the chick itself, like, next-level fire. like one dude stuck in a crammed city full of houses and sewer stank who finally bounces on a summer morn to breathe that village-farm oxygen and finds delight in every rural drip—from the aroma of grain, tedded grass, kine, dairy, every rural sight and beat be like a flavor bomb; and if by chance a nymph-step fine virgin struts by, her whole look sums up that peak delight. so extra did the serpent vibe when he peeped this flowery plat—the sweet secret chill zone of eve, hella early and rollin solo—her heavenly form angelic but extra soft and feminine, her graceful innocence and every subtle gesture completely snatchin his malice, wreckin his fierce intent into a sweet, rapine bereft mess, abstractin even his own evil, leavin him stupid good and totally disarmed of enmity, guile, hate, envy, and revenge

but yo that hot hell forever burnin inside him, even when he was chillin mid-heaven, soon iced his delight and started to torture him even more every time he peeped pleasure he wasn’t meant for, and then straight-up fierce hate crashed his brain with all his mischief thoughts, hypin’ him on that drama nonstop—like, damn, thoughts wherrr u leadin me? so bombarded by that extra sweet compulsion he forgot what landed us here! hate not love, no hope of paradiso for hell, no taste of pleasure at all except that which destroys pleasure itself—seriously, all other joy got yeeted out. then him be like, “yo don’t let this moment slide, peep that one woman, the ultimate op, whose hubby i can’t even see ‘round here cuz his high smarts and chiseled hero build got me shook—hell had me debased and pain got me so weak compared to my old hella fly heaven mode.”

she was, like, divinely fair af, perfect love material for the gods, not scary even if terror be in love and beauty gets closer with even stronger hate, hate so beastly under that phony act of love; that’s the dirt i’m headin down to her epic downfall. so spittin off, the enemy of humanz—trapped in full serpent mode, total inmate bad vibes—rolled up to eve not all lowkey on the ground but straight-up showin his rear, a circular base of rising folds stacked like a surgin maze, his head all crested high with carbuncle-eyes, sporting a burnished neck of lush, verdant gold, standin erect amid spinnin’ spires floatin redundant on the grass like legit art; his whole shape was the definition of dope and lovely—never before seen in any serpentine squad, not even those switchin in illyria like hermione and cadmus, or that god in epidaurus, or even the transformed ammonian jove or capitoline vibes; he was with olympias, and that chick who birthed scipio, the highth of rome. slidin obliquely like one who wanted access but was hella scared to interrupt—side-long he weaved his way, like a ship steered by ultimate pros near a river’s mouth or headland where winds flip the sail on repeat—so twisted was his path that his tortuous train curled mad wild wreaths all in eve’s line of sight to lure her eyeballs, but she was on her own, catchin only the rustlin’ leaves sound, not trippin cuz she was used to that squad energy in the field from every beast, more dutiful to her call than even the circean call that had the whole herd disguised

then, bold as ever and uninvited, he just stood there starin like he was admirin her: often he bowed his turret crest, flaunted his sleek enamel neck, fawnin and lowkey lickin the ground where she stepped her chill walk. his silent, dumb expression finally got eve to peep his play; he was hella glad when she tuned in, droppin his serpent-tongue organic drip or that sudden vocal impulse, kickin off his fraudulent temptation like a total boss

yo, wonder not, sovereign mistress, if maybe you can even handle that vibe—you, the sole wonder, much less arm your looks, the heaven of mildness, with some disdain cuz i'm comin at you all up in this, greedy and gazin, single and unafraid of your daunting brow, which by the way be extra savage but tucked away; you’re like the perfect mirror of your maker, and every livin thing is starstruck by your gifted, celestial beauty, totally ravishing! even though out there in the wild, these basic beasties got shallow eyeballs that barely catch half of your fair, except for that one dude who sees you—what even is one dude? really, when you’re a goddess among gods, adored and served by endless angels in your daily entourage

that’s the vibe the tempter dropped, his proem tunin in, slidin straight into eve’s heart with words that busted through, even though she was marvelling at first but then, not unamazed, she shot back:

“what u mean?” she asked, like, “language of man droppin from a brute’s tongue, human sense expressed? the first part i figured was straight denied for the beasts—god made 'em mute on creation day so they couldn’t spit any articulate sound; the later part i kinda diss, cuz in their looks they flex hella reason and in their moves, they drop wit mad depth. oh serpentine, you the sneakiest beast in all the fields i ever peeped, yet u ain’t even drippin human voice vibes—so double down this miracle and tell me, how the heck did u get to speak when u were supposed to be mute, and how did u get so extra friendly compared to the rest of the brutish pack, who are just chillin on the daily? drop that wonder, cuz it deserves mad clout.”

to which the guileful tempter clapped back:

“empress of this fly world, resplendent eve, it’s mad easy for me to spill all that you command—no cap, you deserve every order: i was once just like the other grazin beasts munchin on the trodden herbs, full of low-key abject thoughts and only about food and sex, not seein any higher purpose; until one day, roamin’ the field, i chanced upon a dope-ass tree far afield, loaded with fruit of the bombest colours mixed—ruddy and gold, straight flexin. so i bounced closer to check it out when, bam, a savory odour blew off the boughs, hittin’ my appetite harder than the vibe of the sweetest fennel or even the teat drop of a ewe or goat at evenin’—unsucked by lamb or kid just out playin.”

to satisfy that savage hunger for those mad apples, i resolved right then and there not to wait; hunger and thirst, the ultimate mood boosters, were like the dopest persuaders, fired up by the irresistible scent of that alluring fruit, urg in me on the spot. i wound myself around that mossy trunk real quick, cuz up high the branches demanded serious reach like adam-level flexin; and around that tree, all the other beasts were starin, longin’ and mad envious, but just couldn’t hit up the fruit

i climbed that tree where plenty hung, temptin’ me to snatch and chow down my fill—i didn’t hold back; cuz that pleasure, right then, at any feed or fountain, was unlike any vibe i’d ever scored. once i was full and sated, soon enough i peeped a crazy shift in me, like a total level-up in my inner reason power, and got my speech game lit again, even keepin that new shape. from then on, i flipped my brain to deep speculations, with a wide-open mind considerin every visible thing in heaven, on earth, or in the middle scene—everything fair and good: and all that fair and good in your divine semblance and in your heavenly glow, i saw united, no fair equivalent even comin close, which forced me, even if i was hella importune, to come and gaze and worship you as the rightful sovereign of all creatures, the universal dame, straight up

so spilled the spirited, sly snake, and eve, even more shook and clueless, hit back:

“serpent, your mad overpraise got me doubtin the virtue of that fruit—like, originally you proved somethin else; but tell me, where the heck does this tree even grow? how far from here? cuz there’s a whole squad of god-trees growing in paradise, all various and unknown to us; in such insane abundance lies our choice, like a mega stash of untouched fruit, still hangin incorruptible until men grow up for their provision and extra hands help nature offload her birth.”

to which the wily adder, all grin and lit, replied:

“empress, the way is mad set, not long at all; just past a row of myrtles on a flat spot, fast by a fountain, one tiny thicket beyond blowin myrrh and balm—if you ride with my lead, i can bring you there real quick.”

“lead then,” said eve. he took the cue, rollin swift into tangles that made a straight path look like a total hot mess of mischief, his hope skyrocketing and joy visibly launchin his crest, like a wanderin’ fire—a compact, oily vapor that in the night condenses, and in the cold surroundings gets lit into a flame, which they say some evil spirit vibes with, hoverin and blazin with a delusive glow, misleadin that amazed night wanderer off his path to bogs, mires, and oft through ponds or pools



yo, got totally yeeted into the void, like, swallowed up and lost far from any help, deadass in a cosmic meltdown.
so, the ultra sus snake was flexin that glimmer drip, straight up in fraud mode, on god no cap.
and it duped eve—our gullible mama npc—to that banned tree, like, full-on sus escort vibes.
that tree of prohibition, the root of all our 24/7 woes and tragic feels, big yikes fr.
when she peeped that wild tree, she slid into her guide chat, dropping lines like "yo, check dis out", raw af.
yo serpent, we mighta dodged coming here if u hadn't yeeted us into this glitch, mid vibes for real.
fruit be useless for me, even tho there's extra fruit comin' in like bonus loot, smh all over.
all that virtue cred is parked on you, my dude, pure drip on point, legit clout overload.
mad wonder, fam, if ur sus hustle is lowkey the cause of these epic meltdown effects, omg.
but yo, this tree is off the menu—no snacking or even a light touch allowed, complete ban, deadass.
god dropped the boss-level command, straight up mod-sayin: "do not eat", served with savage authority, no cap.
it's like his one and only voice daughter, while the rest of us are just free roamin like lost discord memes, fr.
we got self-law, yo—our own brain is the rulebook, on that noob-free logic, straight yeet energy.
then the tempter slid in, guile dripping like secret sauce, reply mode activated, pure cosmic flex.
for real, god was like, "yo, that fruit is a no-go," dropping truth like a mod banning your snack, deadass.
for all these garden trees, no munchin allowed, it's a straight-up "do not eat" scroll on loop, lol.
yet, the lords from earth and air squad up somewhere like, "what even? who holds the permit for these bites?" smh.
so eve, still sittin sinless as ever, goes like, "nah fam, i can eat every tree's fruit," all chill.
on every other tree, it's open buffet mode—feast on all that fruit, yeet all the way!
but for that one bomb fair tree smack in the middle, it's a whole different vibe, extra special drama.
god said, "yo, u shall not snack on that one," complete ban, like a mod on hardcore duty, no cap.
and even a tap is off limits, dude—unless u wanna get yeeted straight to the afterlife, massive oof.
she barely spit her line when the tempter came back even bolder, leveling up that hype, insane mode.
that tempter, rockin' zeal and love like a full on emoticon storm, flexin wild on man-mode, it’s lit.
hitting up man and flippin shade at his wrongs with indignation, throwing fiery clout moves, smh.
he rolled out a new patch with wild passion, move fluid like a viral remix, no stops, yeet on.
vibes fluctuated all over, a bit disturbed but still smooth and on-beat, epic in action, for real.
raising up like an epic quest start, as if droppin the first level of a mega saga, total high-key energy, fr.
like in the old days when that famous orator, a legit meme master, dropped epic lines in a historic glitch, smh.
in athens or that free rome, where slick eloquence flowed like trending hashtags, on god style, dude.
flourishing since the mute mode until they got woke for a major cause, spittin' truth like viral tweet threads, no cap.
standing all collected in one lol pose, every part synced like a perfect discord stream, mad coordinated.
each move, each act got audience clout before the tongue even hit the mic, instant virality, deadass.
sometimes it kicked off in high gear, no lag time, like immediate upload of epic content, straight up.
with zero intro needed, his right zeal was on point, spilling hot takes without delay, full savage mode.
so whether standing or moving or leveling up to mountain high vibes, it was all epic in the instant, fr.
the tempter, all fired up with passion, launched his whole epic meme roast session, on full display, no cap.
oh, sacred wise plant, the ultimate wisdom dispenser, like the dank queen of chlorophyll, super lit.
mama of science, yo, now i’m catching your power vibes, pumping straight through my circuits like a power-up, deadass.
inside me, it's crystal clear—i can peep the causes and decode every hidden meme, no cap.
not only seeing causes but trackin the sneaky ways of all highest hacks, like a secret discord trail, fr.
of the top-tier agents, always deemed on that wise drip, even if sus sometimes, pure legend mode.
queen of this universe, yo, don't buy into those stiff death threat roasts, they're total fake news, lmao.
those rigid death threats, all "you shall not die"—nah fam, it's bogus, cancel the scare, on god.
how should u die? by snacking fruit? c'mon, that fruit is the life juice that powers u up, epic upgrade, fr.
it fuels that knowledge, so if the threatener tries to act, just look at me, already flexin’ that power, yeet.
i'm the one who touched and sampled the goods, and both me and the fruit still vibin', gliding through the glitch, no cap.
and life got a sick upgrade beyond what fate had on deck—a full-on perfection patch, fr fr.
i leveled way above my basic lot, venturin' higher like a genuine gigachad, upgraded status, on god.
so why should that portal be closed to man while the beast gets an open all-access pass? wild scheme, lol.
is it open for beast mode? or will god catch those vibes and throw his epic ire like a cancel mod, hot mess, deadass.
for such a low-key petty breach? instead of clappin your fearless drip, he should be hyping u up, lol no joke.
more like, your bold, dauntless vibe—when death hits with pain, you remain untouchable, legendary style, lol.
whatever death even is, denounced like a lame excuse, it can't hold back this epic spirit, no cap.
it doesn't stop u from chasing moves that might lead to a next-level happy life modem, pure upgrade drip, yes.
to a way happier life, unlocking that full knowledge of both good sauce and evil drip, like double upgrade combo, on god.
for that good—how just is it? and for evil, if evil is even real, what's the point? mad existential vibes, lmao.
if evil's the real deal, why isn’t it known already, since ghosting dodges it easier? extra sus, no cap.
therefore god can't just hurt u and claim justice, like spamming harm doesn't match his flex, deadass.
not just, not even god; if u ain't scared then, u ain't even obeying—the fear cancels itself, lol.
your own fear of death yeets out and zaps the scare, like self-cancelling fear boost, epic shift.
so why the ban? maybe just to smash u into awe and keep u on that low key, tongue-tied mode, smh.
like, it’s to keep u all lowkey n00bs and in the dark—ignorance is their game to keep u under, deadass.
his worshippers, fr, he knows that when u munch down, even though your eyes seem lit like 4k clarity,
they still be low-res and dim, just waiting to upgrade, glitchy mode intact, on god.
but then, boom, they get fully opened and cleared like a high upgrade, magic moment, yeet.
and u’ll be upgraded, basically gods among memes, pure omniscience, mega flex, no lie.
so knowing all that good and evil like the big cosmic admins, full 360 wisdom, on fleek.
so u become gods, since me as a man is just a small dip in the cosmic meme pool, basic levels and all, lol.
the internal man is only as proportioned as his space allows, lowkey basic, ratio minimal.
i, a raw brute human, while u, mixing human and god swagg, become epic—like human upgraded to deity, no cap.
so maybe u gonna die, for real, by dropping that human skin to switch on god mode, wild risk, deadass.
shedding the human vibe to rock god aesthetics; death becomes like a side effect, wishable in the upgrade, smh.
even threatened death ain't worse than this wild upgrade glitch can bring, epic paradox, on god.
and what even are gods that man can't eventually morph into, like the ultimate upgrade, deep vibe, lmao.
can man partake in that godlike snack and get his own taco of divinity, epic food for thought, no cap.
the gods were the og first movers, using that advantage like the ultimate prime meme founders, on fleek.
on our belief that all things drip from them like cosmic startup code, legit accountability, deadass.
i lowkey question that, cuz this bomb earth i peep is fire and glowing like a solar meme, raw.
warmed by that blazing sun, producing every style of dank drip and nature hustle, on god.
if those gods are literally everything, then who even locked up the know how in this tree, extra sus?
knowledge of good sauce and evil drip hidden inside this banned tree, like a secret nft, major drip, no cap.
whoever munches on that fruit instantly levels up their brain with wisdom points, viral upgrade, yeet.
getting that wisdom without asking permission? and like, where's the beef in that offense, hmm?
what's the big offense if man scores that super knowledge? like, no harm, just extra upgrade sauce, lmao.
what can that knowledge even do to him, or the tree droppin' it, if it's all in the public meme dump, on god?
if all this epic juice is his to tap, then even the tree's gift is like unlocked co-op mode, legit.
or is it just envy? can envy settle even in those heavenly vibe chests, like a weird troll in the heavens, deadass?
in those celestial bosoms? yeah, these and a pile more crazy reasons make you crave that bomb fruit, wow.
all those reasons fire up your need for this fair and epic fruit, import times infinity, for reals.
oh goddess of chill humanity, stretch out and grab that fruit, taste it free like a viral giveaway, no cap.
he wrapped up his speech loaded with sly guile and epic meme sauce, straight smooth.
and slid right into her heart like an effortless insta dm, bypassing all firewalls, on point.
her eyeballs locked on that dope fruit, so mesmerizing it screamed "epic snack", pure siren mode, deadass.
it was the ultimate temptation by itself, and in her ears echoed that persuasive drip like a catchy loop, omg.
the sound of his word drops, impregned with slick logic and meme-fueled truth, blasting through like wi‑fi to your soul.
blended with reason and appearing hella true, it smashed her mental firewall with raw truth, so extra.
meanwhile, at high noon, the clock hit like an epic meme time and woke up that savage appetite, on god.
an insane hunger got triggered by that bomb fruity smell, makin' her senses go wild—total overload, fr.
so damn savoury was that fruit, dripping desire like a viral challenge, all crisp and enticing, mad yum, no cap.
she was now totally inclined to reach out, touch, or gobble that juicy vibe, impulse mode activated, yeet.
her eyes got solicited by that longing fire, but first, a sec pause for that inner dm check, fr.
but she hit pause, musing to herself in a deep meme crisis, like "this is lit but risky," on god.
yo, your virtues are epic, no doubt, best of all fruits, like the ultimate flex of nature, fr.
even though kept away from us mere mortals, still worthy of mad admiration, can't lie.
its taste, long withheld until that first epic trial, dropped major extra flair, like the silent god‑fame, smh.
gave voice to the silent ones and schooled the mute crew, like turning on the mic for the voiceless, epic.
making even the tongue not built for chat roar praises like viral soundbites, total speech upgrade, no cap.
even the dude who banned you couldn't hold back from praising you, ironic af, dripping approval.
he ain't hiding it; he straight up named you the tree of all dope knowledge and drip, hon, real talk.
of that knowledge, both the good sauce and the evil drip, mixed like a perfect meme cocktail, on god.
bans us from tasting you, yet that total forbidding just amps up your mystique, ironic twist, lol.
it actually boosts your rep while hinting at the sweet benefits u pass on, major subtle flex.
the goodness that u transmit is exactly what we crave, fueling our epic need, on display.
cause unknown good ain't really lit unless u have it, or if had but still unknown is like, nothing, nah.
and if it's unknown, it's basically the same as never having it, complete ghost mode, big oof.
so plain speaking, what he truly bans is our knowledge, just keeping it locked from our reach, deadass.
banning the good, banning us from being wise—like a weak mod setting, so petty, lmao.
these bans don't even bind, but if death tags us with chains after, then what’s the profit, real talk.
if death chains us with after‑bands, what’s the gain in our inner freedom? like, pointless debugging, smh.
our inner freedom gets totally clowned if the moment we munch on that epic fruit, real deal high stakes, no cap.
cause the moment we snack that fair fruit, our doom drops hard—yeeet, we're done, r.i.p., big oof.
so what's up with the serpent? dude ate and is still livin’, flexin’ on all haters, mega snack king, on god.
he’s now wise, talkin’, reasoning, dishing out advice, discerning like a professor of epic memes, straight savage.
he was totally irrational before that point—guess we ain't the only ones, bro.
was death even invented for us only, or was this brain‑snack purposely withheld from mere mortals, extra tough, idk.
this intellectual grub, like reserved only for the beast squad? mega sus if true, on god.
for beasts that seems to be the case, but that one beast who first got a taste,
never got all jelly, instead brought in pure joy like a viral uplifting moment, straight chill, no cap.
the good hit him, totally unexpected, like a secret drop from fate’s own merch, legit.
and he stayed hella friendly to man, not shady, no deceit, just genuine vibe, on god.
so what should i fear then? like, what is even there to be scared about in this wild glitch, lmao.
under this whole ignorance of good sauce and evil drip, everything seems transparent, no lock.
about god, death, law, or penalties—just background noise in our epic free mode, fr.
here sprouts the ultimate cure‑all—the bomb fruit divine droppin' that pure life hack, mega legit.
it’s a total visual flex, super inviting for your taste buds, like direct insta‑glam, on fleek.
it packs virtue that upgrades you to wise mode—so what’s even holdin u back?
to grab and feast on it, feeding both body and mind in one simultaneous epic snack attack, no cap.
so sayin', in that rash hour of darkness, her impulsive hand shot out fast, like a glitchy speedy click, yeet.
she reached out for the fruit, plucked it with savage finesse, and chowed down like it was her last meme, full munch mode.
the earth itself got hit by that wound; even nature, sittin' on her throne, felt the pain, total heartbreak, oof.
nature sighed hard through all her dope works, signaling deep woe like an eternal sad news flash, mad emo.
everything went kaput; then the guilty serpent slunk back into the dark thicket, hiding like a busted influencer, lowkey.
that guilty serpent, totally should've dipped; 'cause eve was in full taste mode, distracted af.
her focus was all on that sick taste, ignoring every other vibe—one-track mind, pure dedication, no cap.
in that moment, pure delight shined through like she'd never experienced a snack so epic before, big mood.
fruit she never even tried before—whether it was legit or just hype, who even knows, deadass.
or maybe she got high expectations riding that fantasy wave, it was next‑level envisioned, on god.
of, like, ultimate knowledge—the thought of godhead didn’t even cross her noob mind, she was just in taste mode, lol.
greedily, she stuffed herself with that fruit with zero chill, wild munching hype activated, total free‑for‑all.
and she had no clue that eating it wasn’t death’s invite; she got totally satiated in one epic go, on overload.
and then she got all hight on it like boozy vibes, jocund and blessed with boon energy, mega uplift, fr.
so, to herself, she started livin' happy in that self‑pleasing, snack‑induced haze, pure self‑love, no cap.
oh sovereign tree of all, you are virtuous and one‑of‑a‑kind, the rarest of all trees, ultra precious, on god.
in paradise itself, the operation is blessed—total divine startup mode for eternal wisdom, epic like that.
to that sapience, once hidden and defamed but now glowed up, insanely revered, deadass.
let your fair fruit just hang there forever, endless chill mode, like an eternal drip of beauty, on fleek.
created for the ages; but from now on, i'm on a morning care hustle for you, starting early, no cap.
with a daily jam session and proper praise every morning—like sunrise beats, epic and full of life, straight fire.
i will tend to you, easing the heavy fertile burden of your branches, all while streaming pure love, fr.
offering your lush branches as free clout to everyone—like open‑source knowledge vibes, legit.
till fed by your drip, i mature in knowledge and grow up in that divine food program, upgraded like a true prophet, on god.
in wisdom, just like the gods who got that all‑knowing flex, no cap, epic intellect on display.
even though others are jelly of what they can’t even drop, envy mode on, pure meme envy, lol.
for if that gift was theirs, it wouldn’t have grown here like it did—just wasted potential, smh.
so grown up, my experience now is owed to you, best guide ever, on that life hack drip, no cap.
without following you, i’d still be stuck in ignorance, like a clueless noob lost in the feed, deadass.
but you opened up wisdom’s secret path, like a cheat code to knowledge, epic unlock, fr.
and granted access even though that secret wisdom tried to ghost out, real subtle upgrades, on god.
and maybe i myself am a secret, 'cause heaven is super high—like altitude flex, outta reach, tbh.
so high and remote, you can barely spot distinct vibes from up there, like a hidden thread in the cosmos, deadass.
every single thing on earth, and maybe other distractions too, got lost in that cosmic scatter, on fleek.
might have diverted attention from that nonstop watch of divine order, total off‑grid mode, bruh.
our great forbidder, chilling with all his sneaky spies around him, on constant mod patrol, legit secure.
but what vibe should i drop for adam? like, what form should it take, real talk, no cap.
should i even pop up? should i reveal my whole change to him, spill that secret upgrade, epic style?
should i let him in on my evolution and let him partake in that full epic happiness together, or nah?
full‑on happiness with me, or maybe not, like a co‑op game not worth the shared load, smh.
or keep all the odds of that sweet knowledge locked up in my own power, solo mode on that secret stash, deadass.
no copartner, just me controlling the diff—adding what’s missing to draw his love deeper, real flex.
like, the more i stack up my female vibe, the more it draws his love, pure magnet mode, on god.
making me more on par with him; maybe even leveling my whole equal game, pure upgrade, lmao.
a totally desirable perk, which ain't even bad—more like a bonus you always want, smh.
maybe even superior sometimes; but if the inferior's free, then that might be alright—dropped on the balance scale, idk.
this might work, but what if god peeps the whole scene and calls it out, like that famous cancel swipe, extra drama, fr.
and then death happens? i’ll vanish, no more me, like wiped out by a cosmic reset, big oof, on god.
and adam, hitched to another version of eve, switching servers and logging into a new life, deadass.
will live chill and enjoy while i'm been canceled, extinct mode activated, total heartbreak, smh.
a death to even process, and i confirm-it: i resolve to share my destiny, epic but tragic, on god.
adam will share with me, whether in bliss or in deep woe—like co‑op in the ultimate saga, ride or die, fr.
i love him so freakin' much that with him, i could handle all the departures and resets, no cap.
i could take on every death, but without him, life ain't even a game—total zero, on god.
so sayin', she bounced away from that epic tree, turning her step with pure decisive yeet, vamoose mode.
but first, she paid low‑key homage to that inner power, like a silent nod to the sovereign mod, respect on.
the power dwelling inside, whose presence had pumped that plant with smart sap, epic infusion, fr.
infusing the plant with that sciential sap, like derived straight from a divine formula, on god.
from that nectar, the ultimate drink of the gods—adam, meanwhile, was chill in his wait mode, pure devotion.
waiting, all desires high, he had woven a garland of the choicest flowers, like a masterpiece of love, epic drip.
a garland made of the freshest, choicest flowers, designed to adorn and crown her tresses in divine style, yes.
to deck out her tresses and crown her humble rural labors, like the harvest queen in timeless glow, on god.
just like reapers customarily honor their harvest queen, tradition on fleek with epic vibes, lol.
he promised mega joy in his mind, new solace flashing in his thoughts with every beat, total upgrade, fr.
solace in her long‑delayed return, like a saved livestream finally going live, missed dearly, on god.
yet sometimes his heart, divine and hinting at some dark, ill vibes, misfiring like a broken stat, oof.
it misgave him, and he felt that his steady measure was faltering, glitching out like a lagging server, sad af.
and he bounced off to meet her, taking the same route she had logged on that morn, rapid dash mode on.
the morn when they first split up: by that famed tree of knowledge, the epic portal, no cap.
through that tree of know‑how he had to pass; and there he met her, pure synchronicity, mega vibes, for real.
barely back from the tree, and in her hand she held a branch, super fresh picked, like a glowing nft.
a bough of the fairest fruit, radiating a downy, charming smile like a lit emoji, on fleek.
newly gathered, its ambrosial aroma diffused around like a trending scent—totally viral, deadass.
she hustled toward him, fast af; on her face a quick excuse flashed, like a rapid reply in a dm, smh.
she came with a mini prologue and an apology so prompt it was tweet‑length, irony loaded.
and with bland yet willful words, she addressed him proper, like pre‑scripted text in a random chat, on god.
yo, adam, haven't u wondered about my long‑ass stay here, like, "where u been?" on constant loop, fr.
i missed ya so bad, felt like an eternity deprived of your epic presence, straight up agony of love, no cap.
your presence was a must‑have, and the lack of it brought that raw agony of love, like a broken heart meme, legit.
i won't feel it twice, 'cause i ain't tryna subject myself to that pain again—nah, never again, on god.
i mean, i ain't out here trying what rash, untested vibes i once sought, total misfire, lmao.
the pain of not seein’ you was wild, but strangely, it sparked this crazy internal remix, epic yet brutal, fr.
that cause was totally the trigger, and it was wonderful to hear the unknown beats, like a secret track dropping, on god.
this tree ain't what they told us, fam—it's not some dangerous toxic snack, more like a quirky cosmic plant, smh.
it ain't a danger chest nor a portal to unknown evil, it's more like a divine upgrade gift, crazy twist, no cap.
it opens up your eyes, but with a divine effect like unlocking hidden skins, pure magic, on god.
it makes your peepers open wide and turns u into gods who can literally taste the drip of life, mega profound upgrade, fr.
and so it got tasted like that—serpent, all wise and sly, dropped that bomb as the ultimate taste test, cosmic wisdom on fleek, deadass.

yo, check it, we ain't been held down or following orders deadass – we went full yeet on that forbidden fruit and got juiced up with mad human drip, like our voices and vibes got upgraded into full-on miracle mode, reasoning turned into straight-up admiration, so much so that i dipped in too and got a taste of that wild upgrade – eyes popped, spirit stretched, heart on mega boost, leveling up to godlike flex that i was chasing hard, cuz without you the vibe is sus af and bland, no cap.

yo so taste that same drip so we all link up in equal joy and love vibes; cuz if you skip that flavor then we split on different wavelengths and i’d be too late to ghost godhood for you when fate be like, “nah, fam.”

and so eve, all chill and lit, dropped her story in carefree flex, but yo, her cheek was straight-up glowing with that savage mood glitch like extra fire.

adam, on the flip, got hit with that fatal oof from eve – left him shook, blank like a busted screen while horror chills raced through his veins and his joints just hit sleep mode; his garland, meant for eve’s flex, got yeeted from his lazy hand, with faded roses droppin’ like expired memes, leavin’ him speechless and ghostly pale till he finally broke his inner mute with a lowkey, depressed rant.

oh fr fr, the ultimate glow-up of creation, the boss-level masterpiece in god’s squad, the creature flexin’ every aesthetic you can imagine – holy, divine, good vibes, mega amiable, and hella sweet, an icon, no cap.

bro, how you got so totally lost, defaced, and deflowered – now signed up for that death drop? like, how you yeeted past the strict no-touch rule on the sacred fruit, straight-up violating the ban! some shady, cursed troll enemy duped you lowkey and wrecked us both, and now my resolution is set to dip out if i gotta live without you, cuz how can i vibe without your sweet convos and tight love collabs, to be stuck in these wild woods like an absolute loner?

even if god spun up another eve and i got a fresh rib plug, losing you would never ghost my heart nah, fam i’m feelin’ that nature’s bond – flesh of flesh, bone of my bone – you are my ride-or-die, and no matter if it’s bliss or woe, our squad link stays unbreakable.

so adam dropped his truth, and then eve clapped back, all in sync.

oh, epic trial of next-level love, legendary proof and high-key inspo! you’re making me wanna level up like you, adam – i was born from your cherished side and i be vibin’ hard when you drop that union talk, one heart, one soul, bonded af; today’s lit proof shows you’re so resolved that not even death or any other mega sus force can split our squad – even if we both snagged that forbidden fruit, which still carries some wild vibes of goodness whether direct or accidental, basically giving us a chance to ascend into god or angel status, demi-god style, no cap.

if i truly thought this wild move would spark non-stop death drama, i’d roll solo through the worst mess and rather dip, ghosted forever, than drag you into toxic vibes that wreck your chill—especially when you’re so ride-or-die and true. but nah, i feel the flip: not death, but a next-gen upgrade of life, cracked open eyes, fresh hype, new joy bombs, and a taste so divine that the old sweet feels now seem basic and harsh af.

based on my own wild ride, adam, go ahead and snack on that vibe – let all your death fears get yeeted to the wind. with that real talk, she wrapped him up in a tight hug and teared up tenderly, joy overflowin’ cuz his love had him so hyped he was down to risk divine wrath or even a fatal drop just for her, no cap.

as payback (cuz if you’re gonna obey, you deserve the epic treats, no lie) she lobbed him that bomb-ass, enticing fruit right off the branch with a liberal hand; he didn’t even hesitate to munch it, not fooled by his better sense, but totally overcome by that female charm, legit.

the earth itself started tremblin’ from deep within, like her guts were in agony again, and nature let out a second savage groan while the sky got all gloomy, muttering thunder and droppin’ sad, cry-lame raindrops over that epic mortal sin. meanwhile, adam was feasting like a boss, not givin’ a single thought, and eve didn’t even rehash her previous screw-up – she just chilled, comfortin’ him with her tight, loved-up vibe; so much so that, like drunk on new wine, they both were swimmin’ in LOL-worthy mirth, fantasizing they had divine wings to flex on the earth, straight-up bossin’ it.

but yo, that fake fruit hit different – sparkin’ raw, carnal fire, a whole other operation of desire; he started throwin’ lascivious, catch-in-4k eyes at eve, and she hit him back with wild, wanton repays – their lust was blazin’ and before long, adam got his game on and steered eve into a full-on dalliance sesh on hardcore, heated vibes.

yo eve, i peep that you’re on that perfect taste tip – super elegant and brainy, bringin’ that gourmet flavor to every moment, so mad props for servin’ it up today. we missed out on mega pleasure while we were in abstinence mode, never knowin’ true relish until now; and if forbidden goodies hit that next-level flavor, i'd be wishin’ we could’ve had a whole tree of that, like ten times over, deadass.

but now, recharged and fresh, let’s go play hard after that delish fare; cuz since the day i first peeped you and locked in our wedding flex, your beauty – decked out in every single perfection – is lightin’ up my senses like a freakin’ inferno, makin’ me mad hyped to enjoy you more than ever; you’re the ultimate bounty from that virtuous tree, straight-up fire!

adam dropped that epic line and didn’t even hold back on his steamy glances or naughty antics—sending amorous vibes that eve caught with her contagious, sparkly eyes; he grabbed her hand, no cap, and led her to a shady spot under a bomb verdant canopy, nature’s own chill zone, where flowers served as their insta-couch – pansies, violets, asphodel, hyacinth, all laid out as the softest, freshest lap of the earth, pure aesthetic vibes.

there they went all in on love and its wild disport, sealing their pact with that mutual guilt that turned into the emblem of their sin, total solace in their rebel vibe; then dewy sleep crept in like a heavy reset after their amorous binge, as the potent force of that bogus fruit—blowing their minds like a hazy vapor—finally faded out; and a gross, extra sleep, born of nasty fumes and tangled up with rough dreams, left them slack. they woke up all glitchy from their unrest, glancing at each other and realizing how wide their eyes were open and how dark their minds had gotten; innocence, that sweet veil that used to block out all the bad juju, was totally yeeted—leaving only raw confidence, native righteous vibes, and honour exposed to a heavy dose of guilty shame, so much that even his robe, tryin’ to cover up, just ended up revealing more.

then, boom, outta nowhere rose the danite boss, herculean samson, fresh from the harlot-lap of philistean dalilah, all stripped of his strength and left completely destitute and bare of virtue; silent and totally confounded, they sat there mute for ages, until even adam, no less abashed than eve, finally dropped those constrained words, heavy with truth.

yo eve, in our worst, darkest hour, you lowkey tuned in to that fake worm’s vibe – the one who schooled you on fakin’ man’s voice; true in our epic fall but all bogus in that promised rise-up—cuz once our eyes popped open, we found the hard tea: we now know both the good and the bad, with the good ghosted and the evil snatching receipts; that rotten fruit of mad knowledge left us stripped naked, void of honour, innocence, faith, and purity – our classic drip now soiled and stained, our faces flashing the signs of filthy lust and desperate cravings, stackin’ up all that evil; even shame, that final nasty evil, is locked in. so, like, how the heck can i ever look at the face of god or an angel again with that old joy and rapture vibe? those heavenly peeps are gonna blind us with their insufferably bright blaze – damn! oh, might i be doomed to live savage and alone in some hidden glade, deep in woods that block out every star and ray, all broad and brown like eternal dusk – cover me up, ye pines! ye cedars with your endless branches, hide me so i never gotta face that glare again!

but yo, since we’re in this raw, cringey mess, let’s brainstorm a savage hack to hide the most embarrassingly shady parts – the bits that make us look unclean af; maybe we can find a dope tree with those broad, smooth, synced leaves that wrap around our midsections so that this fresh wave of shame don’t crash our vibe and call us out as filthy.



so he was like, deadass droppin’ counsel and yo we all yeeted together into the dank woods, no cap,  
rollin’ into the thickest, most sus wood ever where they peeped that fig-tree—nah not your basic fruit flex but that vintage, indigenous drip known by the malabar and decan homies, arms spread like a mega gg, branches wild af that spawned mini rib babes all around, forming a lit pillar shade dome that echoed like a bass drop in a meme rave,  
and there, lowkey, an indian herdsman—total npc, ghostin’ the heat and chillin’ in the cool zone—was flexin’ on his herd, loop-holes cut through that maximal shade, bruh,  
gatherin’ leaves broad as amazon targe flex shields, then stitching that drippy waist wrap like a wannabe designer to cover up that cringe guilt and savage shame, oh deadass so unlike that original naked glow hella legendary,  
just like columbus recently peeped the american squad—girt in feathered cincture flex but otherwise naked and wild AF on islands and woody shores,  
so they thought they clapped a fence around their shame, half covered up but still mental state in meltdown mode, they parked themselves to weep hard; not just tears drip-droppin’ but an internal tempest of high-key winds, anger, hate, mistrust, suspicion, discord, twisting their chill zone into a total glitchfest of vibes,  
'cause understanding dipped out and the will ghosted on that old lore, both now bowing to raw sensual appetite snatching dominion from boss-level reason, so from his all-messed up, distempered chest, adam—looking estranged and extra in his altered drip—started glitchin’ his speech to eve,  
like, “yo, if you’d hearkened to my drip and stayed on squad when that wild wander-flame hit you on this cursed morn—I don’t even know where that cray vibe came from—we’d still be lit, not totally despoiled of our good, not shamed, not naked, not miserable like this, fr fr!”  
and eve fired off, “nah fam, let nobody come through tryna flex proof of faith, ‘cause when they hustlin’ hard for clout, they just end up failing hard,”  
then she hit adam with savage tea, “yo what words just popped off your lips, adam, all severe? you tryna blame my lowkey default or your own wild wander will—which, tbh, might’ve been the same if you’d been ghostin’ or even yourself? if i’d never bounced from your side, you’d still be rockin’ that lifeless rib vibe; so why didn’t you, as the alpha, command me with a strict ‘no go’ into that danger zone like you said? nah, you were too soft, allowed it, approved it, even dismissed it,”  
and adam snapped back, “if you’d been rock-solid in your dissent, neither of us would’ve trashed the vibe—so is this supposed to be the love or the repayment of loyalty, ungrateful eve? i was the one who stuck around, could’ve had immortal bliss, but i chose to dip into death alongside you, and now you wanna roast me as the cause of your screw-up? like, what more could i do? i warned you, dished out all the tea about the lurking enemy waiting to pounce—force has zero space on free will, bro!”  
but then, still clinging to that overconfidence like some sigma flex, eve was like, “bro, i might’ve overadmired your perfect drip and thought no sus could touch you—but damn, i rue that error now, and here you are playing the accusation card; so beware, any dude overtrusting a woman and letting her will rule will get served weak indulgence blame at the drop of the clout,”  
and so they spent mad fruitless hours throwing shade at each other, nonstop mutual clapbacks with zero self-roast, their petty contest never seein’ an end.

meanwhile, satan went off on a heinous, spiteful rampage in paradise—full caper mode—slipping into that serpentine disguise and flipping eve’s vibe to taste the fatal fruit, and check it, it all went down in heaven ‘cause god, the all-seeing, misses no drip and can’t be fooled, omniscient af; never did the big boss block satan from tryna remix man’s mind, since man was born with full free will and max strength to scope out any shady moves from foe or fake friend,  
‘cause everyone still remembered that high-key injunction to never snacc on that fruit if tempted—yet they went off-grid, incurring major penalty and stacking sin like an endless meme feed, fall status activated,  
so the angel squad yeeted from paradise straight up to heaven in haste—mute, sad, and hella shocked for man—wonderin’ how that subtle fiend pulled off the stealth move, news from earth crashin’ at heaven-gate, droppin’ displeasure everywhere, celestial visages shook with dim sadness mixed with pity but still tryin’ not to break their bliss vibe,  
and a multitudes squad of ethereal peeps raced in to get the deets on the epic fail, rollin’ up to the supreme throne for accountability, spittin’ righteous pleas and max vigilance, while the most high eternal father, vibin’ from his secret cloud, dropped a thunderous mic with his voice,  
and then all the assembled angels and powers, fresh from an unsuccessful charge, were like, “yo, don’t get dismayed or tripped out by these earth tea updates—your pure care couldn’t have stopped it anyway; we peeped the prophecy when that tempter first yeeted from hell’s gulf,”  
i had told y’all back then that he’d prevail on his bad errand, seducing man with flattery and stacking lies against his maker, no decree from me ever forced his fall or triggered his free will shift, but deadass, he’s fallen now; all that’s left is the mortal sentence to drop on his major transgression—death got dissed that day,  
and he’s already actin’ like it’s all void ‘cause he ain’t been hit with that immediate smite he feared, but he’s gonna soon find no chill or acquittance by day’s end, ‘cause justice ain’t comin’ back as a scorned bounty,  
so who tf am i sendin’ to judge them? none other than you, vicegerent son—i’ve transferred all judgement to you across heaven, earth, and hell; real talk, i’m all about that mercy collab with justice, sending you as man’s bestie, mediator, chosen ransom and redeemer on a voluntary grind, destined to judge fallen man himself,  
so spake the father, droppin’ his divine message while unfolding his bright glory right into you, his son, blazing that unclouded deity drip, full resplendent dad energy manifest, and you answered back all mild and divine,  
“father eternal, your decree’s ultimate, and it’s my job in heaven and earth to do your supreme will, so you can chill with me, your beloved son, always well pleased. i’m off to judge these transgressions on earth, but remember, whoever gets judged, the worst punch lands on me when the time comes—i took that on before you, no regrets, to ease their doom on me; still, i’ll flex justice with mercy so hard that they’re satisfied and you get that eternal appeasin’,”  
attendance ain’t required, no extra squad needed to witness the judgement except the judged ones; the third one ghosted is condemned, fleeing and rebelling against all law—serpent ain’t getting any conviction, deadass,  
and so, from his radiant seat, the father boss rose in high collateral glory with thrones, powers, princedoms, and dominations riding with him up to the heaven-gate, from where eden and the whole coast were lowkey on display,  
then he yeeted straight down—god-speed style where time don’t even count, minutes wingin’ past all swift—and the sun was chillin’ low in that western vibe from noon while gentle airs fanned the now awakened earth, usherin’ in that cool evening,  
when outta the blue the mild judge, extra chill from his wrath, rolled in as intercessor for man to drop the sentence; god’s voice, echoing through soft winds, hit the garden while day was droppin’, so man and his wifey dipped and hid among the dankest trees until god, all majestic, called out to adam,  
“yo, adam, where u at, normally hyped to meet my distant arrival? i’m missin’ you—i ain’t feelin’ this solo vibe, where duty used to pop up outta nowhere; did i become lowkey invisible or what glitch got you buggin’? come through, fam!”  
and he came, with eve trailing all loth and extra—even though she was the first to off-key offend—both lookin’ mad discount and discomposed; no love in their vibes for god or each other, just glaring guilt, shame, total perturbation, despair, anger, stubbornness, hate, and sketchy guile, major cringe,  
and then adam, all falter and brief like a laggy stream, stuttered, “i heard ya in the garden and got so shook ‘cause i was naked i dipped to hide,”  
to which the gracious judge, without droppin’ any revile, clapped back, “you’ve heard my voice plenty and never freaked, always vibin’ with joy—so why now you tripping hard over being naked? who spilled that tea? did you actually snacc the forbidden tree i charged you not to hit?”  
and adam, all sore and beset, shot back, “oh heaven, today i’m stuck in this evil strait standin’ before my judge; either i own up to my total crime or point the finger at my other half—my partner in life—whose slip, while still loyal to me, i’d rather keep on the down-low than throw in my complaint, but necessity’s a savage and forced me, so i don’t end up with both sin and punishment on my head…”

yo, this sitch is like mad extra, all devolved into total chaos so much that even if i tried to stay silent, u’d catch every lowkey secret i was ghostin’, deadass—  
yo, this bae u spawned as my ride-or-die helpsquad, a perfect drip gift, so fresh and lit, flexin’ that divine level vibe that made my mind go “no cap” and left me clueless to any shady tea, cuz every move she pulled was pure legit, so on god, she slid me that tree snack and i straight-up yeeted a bite, fr fr.  

and then the big boss presence clapped back hard, like “yo, was she ur godmode that u pressed play on her even before the top boss dropped his voice? or was she just ur hype guide, equal or super upgraded, making u yeet your man card and your top spot that god originally set u above her, cuz ur own drip was next level compared to her weak sauce vibes, if u checked ur self—deadass.”  

so then he lowkey slid into eve like, “hey woman, what wild ish did u just cook?”  
eve, all shook and caught in a 4k cringe moment, confessed not before her no-nonsense judge but still, “the serpent straight-up ghosted me with savage lies and i did eat, yo.”  

when lord god peeped the tea, he didn’t even pause—he went savage on that glitchy serpent, calling him a brute for being the tool of mischief and polluting his creation from the jump, so u got accursed like the worst of all, totally vitiated in nature, while man stayed chill ‘cause he kept it unaltered, and then god, in a total cryptic flex, dropped the sin ban hammer on satan first and let that curse rain on the serpent, no cap.  

yo, cuz u went off with that forbidden tree snack, u earned a mega curse—u’re doomed to be lower than every field npc and cattle, forced to belly flop and be munchin’ on dust every single day, legit.  

and then, listen up—god set up eternal beef between u and bae, like permanent enmity between u and her squad, where her baby squad gonna straight-up yeet ur head while u only manage a weak-ass bruise on his heel, big yikes.  

the oracle spit these mad truths, then confirmed when jesus, son of mary aka the second eve, peeped satan crash like lightning from heaven, that prince of the air, who later came back from his grave in a spoiled remix of principalities and powers, flexin’ in open display and ascending bright to lead the whole satanic turf like a boss—so much so that even he, who just dropped his fatal bruise spoiler, got his sentence shifted over to bae, all arranged by celestial admin, deadass.  

imma multiply your sorrow, like error level infinity—u gonna bring out kids in pure sad mode, and u’ll be forced to submit to ur hubby’s rule, he totally be the alpha controller, no cap.  

then adam got slammed real hard, like “yo, cuz u tuned in to ur wifey’s forbidden voice and munched that tree snack i said “do not eat” in ultra hd, the ground’s cursed for ur sake—u’re stuck eating that cursed dirt in sorrow every day, with nasty thorns and extra dank thistles sprouting uninvited, and u only munch on the field’s scraps, sweatin’ out bread till u slide back to dust-land, ‘cause remember, u were born outta dust and will straight-up return to dust, fr.”  

so god, acting as both judge and savior, dropped the death bomb that day, banishing it far away, then peeped them standing raw and naked in full cringe mode, forced into a life change as if servitude was the only flex—like how he once washed his servants’ feet—and now as the top papa he draped their bare vibes in beast skins, whether fresh slain or styled like a snake’s youthful coat, not even bothering to clothe his haters since it’s all about that inner vibe, stretching the nakedness way deeper than any outer drip, big facts.  

clad in his righteous drip robe that blocked his old pops’ view, he bounced with a swift ascent back into his blissful bosom, re-assuming glory like back in the golden days, calming down the all-knowing crew with a sweet intercession mix recounting what went down with man, all while serving that cosmic tea.  

meanwhile, before all the earthly sin drama got judged, inside hell’s gates sat sin and death chillin’ like lame npcs, peeping out wide as the gates belched out outrageous flames into full chaos—ever since that fiend ghosted through, unzipping sin mode, kickstarting death’s grim saga.  

yo, little dude, why we just chillin’, ghost-scoping each other idly while satan, our ultimate author, is out there thriving in parallel worlds with a happier, boujee seat for his dear offspring? deadass, he’s all about that success—if any mishap had come down, he’d have come back in a fury ride by his avengers because no spot like this could ever handle his punishment levels or the revenge drop, real talk.  

i legit feel a wild new strength surging inside me, wings poppin’ up and dominion unlocked beyond this abyss, drawn by some cosmic vibe, deep sympathy, or a connatural force so powerful it unites like-minded souls through a secret signal, yo—my inseparable shadow, u gotta ride along ‘cause not even death from sin can break that bond, deadass.  

but yo, let’s not get stuck in an impassable gulf, so let’s squad up for an adventurous hustle, blending our savage power to carve a fresh path from hell to that lit new world where satan now runs the show—a monument flex for all the infernal homies that eases their drip for next-level transmigration or secret tea exchange, no cap.  

i can’t shake how the new, raw attraction and instinct are pulling me hard, like a magnet of dank feels, deadass.  

and then my lowkey shadow chirps back, “yo, bounce where fate and that strong inclination lead, i ain’t lagging or tripping on ur path—imma trail u tight ‘cause the scent of carnage and unlimited prey is my daily death snack, and i swear i’m here to drop full equal aid for ur epic hustle, no cap.”  

with that, he inhaled the vibe of mortal change on earth like a flock of ravenous birds from way out, flying to a battle zone lured by the sick aroma of living carcasses prepped for the next bloody clash—so our grim homie cranked his nostrils wide into the murky air, sagely peepin’ his quarry from mad far away.  

then both crews bounced outta hell’s gates, scattering into the wide, damp, dark chaos wasteland, flexing insane power as they hovered over waters that were either solid or slimy, tossed up like in a raging sea, all crouched together and driving in shoals toward hell’s gaping mouth, legit.  

it's like when two polar winds, blowing adverse over the cronian sea, team up to shove massive ice mountains that totally block the imagined route beyond petsora eastward to that rich, chill cathaian coast—mad props.  

death, rockin’ an ice-cold vibe with his mace, petrifick and dry as heck, smote like with a trident, nailing things down as firm as delos in its one-time float, while the rest were locked in a gorgonian rigor that wouldn’t budge, and with some epic asphaltick slime as wide as a busted gate stretching deep to hell’s roots they fastened the beach, and an enormous mole whipped up a mega high-arched bridge over the foaming deep—a prodigious length, literally joining this unfenced world to the immovable wall forfeited to death—dropping a smooth, easy, no-drama passage straight down to hell, fr.  

so, if you compare epic to micro, xerxes, repping greece’s freedom to flex, bounced from susa—his high-key memnonian palace—to the sea, bridging over hellespont like a boss, uniting europe with asia, and smacking the indignant waves with mad strokes, no cap.  

then they dropped that wondrous pontifical art—a ridge of hanging rock over the vexed abyss—tracking satan to the exact spot where he first flapped his wings and landed safely from chaos onto this bare round world, using adamant pins and chains to lock it all down super tight and durable, and in a blink the limits of empyrean heaven and this world met up, with hell chillin’ on the left, interposed with a long reach to three separate lit pathways, each connecting these realms, deadass.  

and then they peeped the route to earth, steering straight for paradise; when, behold, satan—decked as a bright angel—vibing between a centaur and a scorpion while the sun popped in aries, came in full disguise, but his own squad decoded his parent vibes way fast, fr.  

after lowkey seducing eve, he ghosted into the nearby woods, switching shapes to spy on the aftermath—peeping his slick move pulled by eve (even though all were clueless and her hubby seconded the lowkey shame), catching sight of their awkward, vain cover-ups; but when he peeped the son of god descending to judge them, he got mega terrified and yeeted, not tryna truly escape but to dodge the present heat, scared of what sudden wrath might drop, so later that night, eavesdropping on the hapless pair’s sad convo and lame complaints, he gathered his own doomy vibes for a future time with extra joy in his news drop, and he straight-up returned to hell—and at the brink of chaos, near the foot of that wild new pontifice, he unexpectedly met his own dear offspring, yo.  

mad joy exploded at that meetup, and peeping that stupendous bridge only cranked his joy to another level, so he stood admiring for a hot minute until sin, his enchanting daughter, broke the silence with her smooth vibe, saying, “yo parent, these ultra epic flexes are ur magnifick deeds, ur trophies that u lowkey act like ain’t even yours; u’re the original author, the prime architect—i peeped it in my heart almost instantly, syncing with u on that secret harmony that proves u prospered on earth, a truth that ur looks scream straight up, no cap!”

yo, even tho the interworld gap is hella sus and mad distant fr i still caught that cosmic vibe like deep inner feels deadass so i gotta trail your epic drip with your mini-me in tow cuz fate’s wild flex got us three locked in a glitchy squad vibe, no cap!

heck nah hell couldn’t box us in with its lame-ass borders and that uncharted void was too extra to keep us from chasing your legendary drip so we yeeted ourselves after your stellar follow-the-leader energy rofl fr!

yo you just clapped our freedom – we were stuck in hell-gates til now but you came thru and leveled our squad straight up giving us that mega boost to flex and build a dope bridge over that dark abyss like a portentous meme drop, legit!

bro the whole world’s now yours deadass your rad virtue snatched wins you never even built with your own hands your mega brain got clout even when war flopped and got totally wrecked and you clapped back our heavenly foes so hard here you reign as the monarch while that other dude got cancelled by his own doom so from now on you slice that throne with his leftover scraps divvyin up everythin’ across those cosmic empyrean borders his whole quadrant got yeeted from your round vibe so now you’re the dangerous challenger to his crown and the prince of darkness be like “aight fam that’s lit” salty but hyped!

yo fair daughter and yo the son and grandkid squad too y’all legit proved you rep satan’s whole crew (and yo i be flexin in that name as the ultimate troll against heaven’s giga king on god fr skibidi)!

i got you mad props from me reppin the whole infernal empire so close to heaven’s door – we smashed our enemies with that epic win and merged hell and earth into one chill continent for easy ride so while i slide down through that dark abyss on your smooth pathway i’m linkin up with my hype crew to flex our wins and celebrate hard yo you two bounce this direction through countless star orbs right down to paradise where the bliss party be lit there you squat and boss up dominatin earth and sky mainly on man who’s supposed to be the solo ruler so first lock him in as your thrall then yeet him out for good!

i sent out my backup a volley of boss substitutes mega charged with no cap power straight from me on earth so the fate of this new kingdom rides solely on your combined hype even when our journey’s cruisin’ through sin and death thanks to my wild hustle if y’all flex that joint power hard enough hell’s drama won’t even cramp our style so squad up and be strong, fr!

after droppin that bomb sermon he yeeted them out with speed zoomin through the thickest constellations spreadin spicy chaos everywhere and leavin the stars all lookin wan while planets got so shook they almost got eclipsed then satan slid the other way down the causey to the hell-gate like a slick butter slide on both sides where fragmented chaos was shoutin its savage truth and with a rebounding surge those barred vibes got smashed so hard that his indignation got roasted through that wide open no-guard gate where satan dipped in and everything around ghosted ‘cause the peeps assigned to chill there had already dipped to the upper world and the rest were hidin inland around the pandemonium walls the city – the proud crib of lucifer (aka that bright star satan repped as icon) – had its legions posted on constant grind while the grand homies in council sat tryna peep if any chance might crash their emperor’s drip so he dipped droppin orders and they all followed like a chaotic group chat on fire!

like when the tartar bounced from his russian beef near astracan over snowy plains or when bactrin sophi dipped from the turkish crescent horns outta aladule retreating to tauris or casbeen these fallen, heaven-banished homies left the outermost hell in a dark league shuffle posted tight around their metropolis always waitin for their epic adventurer from foreign worlds – he lurked as a lowkey plebeian militant angel of the lowest order ghostin’ through that plutonian hall door invisible and then yeeted himself up to a high throne drippin with the richest royal texture at the top so hardcore that when he sat a minute scoping his unseen crew a cloud burst and his blazing head and starry form popped up shining even brighter rockin whatever pseudo-glory remained from his epic fall or that fake glitter and everyone was shook as the stygian squad bent their eyes in awe cravin to peep their mighty chief’s return then the big consulting homies dashed up from their dark divan hyped hard and high-fived as he clapped silent with savage words that captured all the attention, deadass!

thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers if you got that boss-level property i hereby call you out and declare y’all returned from that hopeless infernal pit – that abominable cursed house of woe and our tyrant’s dungeon – now to boss up as lords of a vast world next to our own mini-heaven achieved through my perilous, epic hustle i could go on for ages about the pain and wild voyage through unreal vast uncharted confusion where sin and death laid down a mega remix highway to speed up your glorious march but yo i busted my ass carving out my messy passage forced to ride that untractable abyss like a glitch deep in the womb of unoriginal night and wild chaos which, jelly of its secrets, threw down a million loud protests in a chaotic uproar capping my fate big time – and that’s how i stumbled on the fresh new world hyped in heaven’s headlines as a wunderous fabrick of pure perfection! there man got set up in a paradise our exile turned him into a happy meme i lowkey seduced him from his creator by shady fraud and to max out your shock levels i tossed in an apple bro he got so triggered it’s literally rofl worthy and he ended up handing over both his fave man and the whole damn world as next snacks for sin and death so free for us to roll in, dwell, and rule over man just like he was meant to be ruled, straight up!

real talk he also threw shade at me but not directly at me rather at that basic-ass serpent form i used to scam man so that beef became my property a raw enmity he put between me and mankind where i’m supposed to bruise his heel while his future spawn – if they ain’t set – come and bruise my dome like who wouldn’t trade for a bruise or even harsher pain so there’s the receipt of my epic performance so now gods what’s left but to bounce up and dive into full bliss on god fr!

so having dropped that epic speech he chilled for a hot minute expecting universal shout-outs and claps to fill his ears but instead he got hit with a whack-ass universal hiss like a spam of public roasts from a million twisted tongues and he got all sus wonderin his own vibe as his drawn face got all sharp and spare his arms clung tight to his ribs his legs tangled like a bad game of twister and boom he yeeted into a monstrous serpent mode on his belly forced down by a greater power that punished his sin in that cursed shape according to his grim destiny he tried to spill some heat but every hiss got clapped back with forked tongue hissing at forked tongue so that everyone transformed into snakes like extra accessories on his wild riot and the hall exploded with a dreadfully epic hiss remix as a troll squad of crazy monsters – scorpion, asp, a dire amphisbaena, horned cerastes, hydrus, dreary elops, and dipsas – swarmed like back when the soil dripped with gorgon blood in old ophiusa days all while the ultimate boss turned dragon-snake, bigger than any sun-blessed pythian python, flexed untouchable power above everyone else they all followed him yeeting themselves out to the open field where the leftover dropouts from that chaos rout the heaven-fallen crew hung in random formation all hyped expecting their chief’s triumphant return but instead they got served a gross sight of a horde of ugly snakes that brought on pure horror and mad cringe as they saw themselves morphing their arms dropping spears and shields bouncin to the floor in a flash as the dire hiss restarted and that cursed shape got contagiously caught like punishment for their crime turning every shout of triumph into exploding hiss and self-inflicted shame!

and yo right there stood a random grove poppin up like a surprise patch from the big boss upstairs to up their penance with bomb-ass fruit like that dope bait from paradise that got eve snatched by the tempter’s scheme their eyes went full zoomer locking onto that wild scene imagining one forbidden tree spawning a whole squad of rogue fruit rising up to serve extra woe or shame but even parched with scalding thirst and savage hunger they were too hyped by the delusion to hold back so they rolled in heaps and clambered up trees stacking thicker than megaera’s twisted snaky locks and greedily snatched the pretty fruit like a viral food haul kinda like that fruit near the lit bituminous lake where sodom was on fire but yo this fruit was mad tricky it fooled ‘em with a fake taste not on touch but on flavor they thought it would curb their hunger and instead chewed on bitter ash like trash that got spit out loud and often they tried again starved and thirsting hardcore getting twisted with soot and cinder mess over and over fallin for the same bogus illusion unlike the real man they once clapped so they were forever cursed with famine endless hiss until eventually when their lost form was allowed they bounced back forced each year to ride a humbling numbered sequence of days to crush their pride and joy for that seduced man but yo some old school legends spread among the heathens spillin tea on how that snake they called ophion chillin with eurynome (maybe that wide creepin eve herself) originally ruled high olympus before gettin yeeted by saturn and ops even before dictaen jove was born!

meanwhile in paradise the hellish duo crashed the scene way too early sin was already holdin it down in boss mode before anything could even vibe, deadass!

once actual; now was actual vibes, now i’m stuck in a body deadass chillin to dwell like an npc, yo  
habitual habitant sliding behind her grim death, fr fr, like total ghost mode, skrrt  
close followin pace for pace, still not yeeted on any ride yet, like still clingin to that ride energy  
on his pale horse, the one who sparked sin from the jump, no cap—sin got born right here, deadass  
second spawn from satan’s crew, all-conquering death flexin like a glitch in the matrix, big yikes  
yo what you think about our empire rn, even tho we earned it on that rough travel grind, still just chillin at hell’s dark door, unnamed and undreaded, and you half starved like a broke snack, smh?  
and then the sin-born beast clapped back quick, saying “yo,” full savage mode on deck

to me, who’s eternally starvin like no cap, hell, paradise, and heaven be all same sus vibes,  
best spot’s where the ravines hit harder, but here even if it’s lit with plenty, it’s still mid to pack this massive maw of mine, this vast unbound glitch of a body, lol  
and then the incestuous mama, all sus and extra, slid in with her savage reply

yo so chow down first on these herbs, fruits, and flowers—feed up those taste buds; then snack on every beast, fish, and bird, no basic bites allowed,  
devour anything time’s got mowed down, no matter how chopped up it is, until i, as man incarnate, infect his squad with every thought, look, word, and move—season him as your final, dankest snack, deadass

with that dropped, they both bounced off in mad diverging ways, both tryna destroy or un-immortalize all kinds of stuff, and let destruction mature sooner or later,  
which the almighty peeped from his transcendent flex spot with the saints rollin’ deep, and he belted out orders with that booming vibe sayin, “on god, just are thy ways, righteous all day with those decrees on your drip works; who can even flex against thee?”  
next up shoutout to the son, destined to be mankind’s restorer, the plug who’ll have new heaven and earth rise up for the ages or drop straight down from heaven—such was their anthem, legit banger vibes

meanwhile the creator, callin his mighty angels by name like they were squad members, hit ‘em with a load of charges sorted to match the present drip—real talk, the sun got his boss move precept to move and shine so hard it could hit the earth with barely tolerable cold and heat,  
from the north he summoned that decrepit winter vibe, from the south he ordered solstitial summer heat to blast off,  
the blanc moon got her own role, and the other five planets were set with their own moves—in sextile, square, trine, and opposite, all full of nasty side effects, joinin in unbenign synods and teachin the fixed stars when to drop that malignant influence shower,  
all while some of them risin with the sun or fallin got set to be tempestuous; to the winds he hit their corners when they blew hard enough to confound sea, air, and shore, and even the thunder got timed to roll mad terror through the dark aerial hall, on god

some say he told his angels to flex and twist the earth’s poles, crankin it up twice ten degrees or more from the sun’s axle, hustlin’ that oblique, centrick globe like total boss energy,  
others be sayin the sun got ordered to flip reins off the equinoctial road like a distant flex toward taurus hangin with the seven atlantick sisters and the spartan twins, then slid down full speed by leo, the virgin, and the scales, deep like capricorn,  
all to remix the seasons for every clime—else perpetual spring would’ve been smilin on earth with vernal flowers, days and nights equal except for those stuck beyond the polar circles where day never got benighted, and the low sun, tryna make up for its distance, would just circle the horizon like it forgot east from west, blockin snow from cold estotiland and south under magellan vibes,  
when the sun snacked on that fruit like somethin from a thyestean banquet, it turned its course on purpose; else how would the world, even if sinless, have dodged both cold pinches and scorchin’ heat? deadass

these shifts in the heavens, slow as they may seem, popped off like sea and land changes; sideral blasts, vapor, mist, and hot exhalations—corrupt, pestilent, full on extra—now from the north of norumbega and samoed shores bustin’ out their brazen dungeons armed with ice, snow, hail, stormy gusts and flawed energy,  
boreas, caecias, argestes all hollerin loud, and thrascias rippin’ woods and upturnin’ seas,  
then with adverse blasts comin’ up from the south, notus and afer roll in, thick with thunderous clouds from serraliona,  
and against all that fierce energy, the levant and ponent winds—eurus and zephyr with their lateral noise, sirocco and libecchio—came rushin in, yo  
thus it all started, pure chaos launchin off

mad outrage from lifeless things, but first discord—daughter of sin, that irrational death lady—got tossed in through fierce anti-vibes,  
beasts started beef with beasts, birds went savage on birds, fish clashed with fish; all tryna munch on every herb while snacking on each other,  
and they barely gave a damn bout man—they either ghosted him or glared grim as they passed, like extra shady,  
these mad miseries from outside were already on stage, peeped by adam in part, hidden in the gloomiest shade, left to sorrow and worse felt deep inside,  
and catch this—a troubled sea of passion had adam tossing around his sad complaints just to vent, like tragic af

o miserable happy, so extra sad! is dis the end of this lit new world, and me, uh, so late in the glory game, who now flipped from blessed to cursed?  
hide me from god’s mug, whose face used to be my peak happiness, deadass!  
but yo, if misery were to end here, i’d deserve it and carry my own bad vibes;  
nah, all i munch, sip, or spawn just multiplies that cursed energy, fr fr—i’m talkin propagated hexes, yo  
o voice that once dropped delightful beats and multiplied the hype, now just sounds like death on repeat—what can i multiply but curses on my dome, legit

who in all the ages, feelin’ the evil i dished, wouldn’t curse my head? ill-fated ancestor impure vibes, all thanks to adam, whose “thanks” is really an epic execration, yo—plus all that’s biding on me, everything from me gonna hit back with fierce reflux, smackin’ me on my natural center heavy like extra,  
o fleeting joys of paradise, so damn dear yet bought with forever woes, pure burn

did i even ask you, maker, from my clay, to mold me into this man vibe? did i slide into darkness askin’ to be hyped up or dropped here in this bomb garden? since my will totally didn’t vibe with my creation, it would’ve been on point to just yeet me back to dust, yo—desirous to bail on all this and give back what i got, ‘cause i couldn’t flex on your super hard terms for that “good” i never even wanted,  
so to add extra penalty on my loss, why you stackin endless woes on top? your justice is mad inexplicable, but real talk, i’m too late to contest—should’ve been shut down when you first hit me with those terms, yo  
you accepted 'em, so you gonna enjoy the good then grip on every condition? and even though god made you without askin, what if your son flips, disobedient and all, comin back with “yo why u spawned me? i never wanted none of this!”—would you let that proud excuse slide? nah, cause he wasn’t your chosen flex, just a natural necessity, deadass

god handpicked you as his own, no cap, to serve him, and your reward was mad grace, while your punishment is just his will—fair as heck, so be it i submit, since i’m just dust destined to yeet back to dust, for real

yo welcome hour, whenever that is—why’s his hand delayed from executing his decree from way back on that day? why am i stuck overliving, gettin mocked with endless death and dragged out into everlasting pain?  
how i’d love to just meet mortality, accept my sentence, and be earth-insensible, like straight chillin’ in my mama’s lap, where i could rest and sleep secure with no more that dreadful thunder from his voice, no extra fear of worse coming for me and my crew  
yet one niggling doubt still chases me—what if i just can’t die? what if that pure breath of life, the spirit of man god sparked, can’t dip together with this clod of flesh—so in the grave or some extra dismal spot, who knows if i’ll end up dyin’ a living death? o that thought is horrid if it’s true, but why though? it was just that life breath that sinned—what dies but what once had life and sin, ya dig? the body never really had life or sin proper, so all of me’s gotta dip; let that drop the doubt, since human reach just stops here

for real, even tho the lord of all is infinite, is his wrath infinite too? be it, man ain’t infinite—just doomed lowkey. how can he drop endless wrath on man, who’s gotta end in death? can he even cook up a deathless death? that’d be a bizarre contradiction even for god himself, like an argument of weakness not power, deadass. will he stretch punishment from finite to infinite just for anger’s sake, never ever satisfied? that’d extend his sentence past dust and nature’s own law, where all other causes stick to their own sphere, yo. but then say death ain’t just one swipe that robs your sense, but an endless misery from today on—one i feel started in me and outside me and gonna last for perpetuity—ay me! that fear is extra, fr fr.

yo, comes thundering back w/ that dread revolution energy, skibidi meltdown mode deadass rn  
on my defenceless dome, both death and me caught in 4k eternal glitch, no cap, full yeet vibes  
i'm eternal af, merging all that grim meme juice like a squad of npc rekt souls, fr fr  
nah, i ain’t solo here—inside me every future fam be cursed like a broken loot drop, total cringe storm  
my posterity’s cursed swag is the fair patrimony i gotta yeet over to y’all, sons!  
o, if i could just waste it all myself and leave y’all with nada, pure self-yeet mode activated  
disinherited af, so how u gonna bless me now when u’re stackin’ your own curse? big yikes, fr  
why should all mankind get condemned for one dude’s epic oops—guiltless? (deadass, no cap)  
but from my spill comes only total corrupt drip; mind and will both depraved into trash mode,  
not just slackin’ but willin’ to do the same full glitch, riding my downfall like a busted server  
how they stand acquitted in god’s view when i’m the prime source and genesis of all this dank rot?  
in god’s sight, even after all the debates, i was forced to drop absolution—the evasions all beta, wasted like lag spikes,  
and all my twisted reasoning, lost in maze loops, only leads back to my own conviction—first and last,  
all on me, me only, the improper spring of all corruption, the epic blame burner in the cosmic roast  
so might the wrath, fond wish, could u even support that mega burden heavier than the earth itself,  
like the world split into heavy subframes, even when divided with that shady, bad woman vibe?  
thus, what u desire and what u fear both yeet all hope of refuge, sealing u in miserable glitch mode  
beyond any past fails or future patch notes—only satan gets that double crime and doom flex, ngl

o conscience, into what abyss of mega fears and horrid insta meltdown have u dragged me,  
i’m falling from deep to even deeper—caught in an eternal skibidi spiral, yeet no escape

so adam, mega crushed, lamented loud in the still deadnight,  
not like back when man used to be wholesome, cool, and mild, but now it’s all black air drip,  
accompanied by damp feels and dreadful gloom that hit like a busted meme filter,  
representing double terror like a horror montage on a laggy livestream—  
there he lay, outstretched on that ice-cold ground, sometimes cursing his own creation,  
while death got accused for tardy moves ever since it announced the day of his epic screw-up.  
why ain’t death coming with one thrice-acceptable yeet-slap to end me?  
shall truth flake on her word, and divine justice not hustle up, slow-mo style, no cap?  
but death don’t roll on demand—justice divine be glitching at her own snail pace  
even when o woods, o fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers get summoned to echo my lost clout,  
i schooled your shadow crew to bounce back with a remix track that slaps like extra dank beats, lol

when eve, all sad and desolate, peeped this raw affliction from afar,  
sitting in her forlorn zone like a lost noob in a laggy game room,  
she dropped soft words to cool his fierce passion, tryna patch his meltdown,  
but he, with a steely glare, ghosted her vibe hard—np, bye bye

“off yo screen, serpent!” he roared,  
“that name fits u mad well with your shady league vibes—u’re literally false and hateful, missing nothing except showing yo serpentine scam beneath,  
like his own, with that color full of suss, exposing inner fraud so all creatures get warned to yeet u forever;  
lest that heavenly front u be rockin’, pretendin’ to be lit but really hellish, snare ‘em all in a scam trap!”  
for real, i would've been happy if u’d dropped the pride and wandering vanity,  
but u rejected my lowkey forewarning, disdaining trust like a clout-chaser tryna be seen—even by the devil himself, overweening to flex,  
until meeting the serpent ended in u and me both gettin’ played,  
thinking u’d be that constant, mature, assault-proof homie—  
but it all turned out to be one big staged show, a flimsy rib of virtue crooked by nature,  
bent like a glitch, drawn more to the sinister side and extra than needed—  
if thrown out as an extra add-on, like a supernumerary not in my legit squad,  
well, o! why did god, the original gigachad creator, fill the highest heavens with masculine spirit memes,  
only to drop this novelty on earth—a fair defect in nature,  
and not pack the world full of men like angels, missing that feminine spark?  
or find another hack to generate mankind?  
this mischief never should’ve popped off, nor will it now—  
with countless disturbances and female snares droppin’ chaos like endless beta updates,  
making it nearly impossible for a dude to find a fit mate except by epic misfortune or error,  
or the one he craves most stays locked away by parental firewall,  
or his top pick ends up wedged to some nasty adversary that fuels his hate or shame—  
infinite calamity remixing human life and household peace into one giant, cursed group chat

then he just turned from her—but eve, not repulsed,  
with endless tears and a hair mess spilling at his feet, fell humble, embraced them like a broken plush,  
and begged for his peace, laying out her plaint in raw, glitchy text

“don’t forsake me, adam! witness the heavens to my sincere, cosmic love and reverence,  
i bear you with all my heart even though i unknowing offended and got deceived, total oof!  
i beg, clutching your knees in a supplicant mode—don’t rip away the one thing i live for:  
your gentle looks, your aid, your counsel in this mega distress, my only strength and stay;  
without u, where the heck do i go?  
while we still hustle for even an hour, let there be peace between us two,  
joining our injuries like a co-op against the doom-ass enemy assigned to us—the cruel serpent.  
don’t drop your hate on me, for i’m already mega lost, more miserable than u,  
both of us sinned (but u only sinned against god, while i sinned against both god and you),  
and we’re headed back to that judgement zone where i’ll bawl out to heaven so that the sentence—  
that massive curse removed from u—lights up on me, the sole source of all this woe,  
me, and me only, the exclusive target of his ire, deadass!”

she ended up bawlin’, her low plight immovable till peace popped in from fault acknowledged in adam’s own commiseration—  
soon his heart relented toward her, his late-life sole delight,  
now with her at his feet in deep distress, this creature so fair seeking his reconciliation,  
begging his counsel, the aid she had messed up, as his anger got disarmed by pure chill words that raised her vibe back up,  
unwary and too hungry for that past desire, now telling u that if u choose to take all the punishment on ur own (alas!),  
carry ur own load first ‘cause u ain’t built to sustain his full wrath, which u even feel the tiniest of—  
and my displeasure is just too heavy. if prayers could flip high decrees,  
i’d speed to that place for u so loud that all the curses on my head get hit,  
ur frail, infirmer state forgiven, committed to me and exposed by me, no cap

but yo, rise up—let’s not contend or blame each other (we’ve been roasted enough elsewhere);  
instead, work in the office of love, lighten each other’s burdens in our shared woe,  
since today’s death got dissed and if anything i see won’t be a sudden drop but a slow-mo evil update,  
a long day of dying just to add to our pain, and to our seed (o hapless seed!) that’s set to drop,  
so to eve, with a recovering heart, replied:

“adam, through this sad experiment i know my words weigh like zero with u—they were such epic errors,  
unlucky by the event’s script; but still, restored by u, even though i’m vile as i am,  
i’m given a new place of acceptance, clinging to hope to regain your love—the sole contentment of my heart.  
whether livin’ or dyin’, i ain’t gonna hide what thoughts be risin’ in my unruly chest,  
aimin’ for a lil relief of our extremes or an end—sharp and sad yet somehow tolerable,  
like our evils bringin’ us an easier choice.  
if our descent’s care perplexes us most—destined to be born into certain woe devoured by death at last,  
and if we turn into misery for others, spawning our own cursed race into this doomed world,  
a woeful crew eventually fodder for some foul monster—  
it lies in ur hands to stop this before conception of the unblest race.  
childless u art, so remain childless: death gets duped out, forced to snack on us two,  
like a ravenous maw that never gets full.”

but if u judge conversin’, lookin’, and lovin’ as super hard and difficult,  
abstainin’ from love’s due rights and those nuptial, sweet embraces,  
and if u’d rather languish without hope before the object of desire dies of its own languish—  
which would be misery and torment less than all we dread—  
then, free ourselves and our seed from all that fear, let’s keep it short:  
let’s go seek death; or if he ain’t found, we supply his exit ourselves,  
why keep shiverin’ under endless fears that lead only to death, when plenty of ways exist to choose the shortest demise—  
destruction stacked with destruction to self-undo the chaos, right?

she ended here, as vehement despair broke off the rest—  
so much death in her thoughts had tinted her cheeks pale,  
but adam, unmoved by such counsel, clung to higher hopes, his attentive mind laboured on,  
and thus dropped a reply to eve.

“eve, ur contempt for life and pleasure seems to shout that u got somethin’ way more sublime and excellent  
than what u or ur mind disses, but seekin’ self-destruction totally refutes that excellence—it implies u feel not just contempt but deep anguish and regret  
for losin’ a life and pleasure you once overloved.  
or if u’re starin’ death as the ultimate end of misery to dodge the harsh penalty,  
doubt not that god’s armed his vengeful ire even wiser than that,  
so much that i fear if death gets snatched up, it won’t free us from the pain we’re doomed to pay—  
rather, such rebellious acts will stir the highest power to make death live in us.  
then let’s hunt for a safer resolution, which i got in sight, callin’ to mind part of our sentence,  
where ur seed totally bruises the serpent’s head for piteous amends,  
unless that was meant for our grand foe—satan himself, who, rockin’ the serpent vibe, contrived this scam against us.  
to crush his head would be legit revenge, but that gets lost if death comes via our own hands or if we stick to childless days as u propose;  
then our foe escapes his ordained punishment while we double our curses on our own heads.  
no more mentionin’ violence, aight?  


against ourselves; and wilful barrenness, deadass we yeeted our hope off our feed like glitchy pcs, smh no cap bruh  
that cuts us off from hope; and savours only pure salt energy, rancor, mad pride, and impatient beef, oof fr fr  
rancour and pride, impatience and despite, like straight-up npc vibes spitting doomscroll drama, big yikes fam, errrr  
reluctance against god and his just yoke, lowkey resisting his drip like a cloutless noob tryna flex, straight sus  
laid on our necks, yo. remember how he chilled with that mild & gracious vibe, catching our error without throwing fits, on god  
and gracious temper he both heard, and judged, like he was tuning into our soft meme hums without any roast mode, deadass  
without wrath or reviling; we were buckling up, expecting that instant dissolution drop like a busted update, no cap  
immediate dissolution, which we thought was the final beta drop meant to yeet us into that death glitch, fr fr  
was meant by death that day; when lo! caught in 4k, pain mode in childbirth got lit, skibidi wild  
pains only in child-bearing were foretold, like mad cramp memes and wailing soundbites, big oof real talk  
and bringing forth; then the joy drop hit hard, recompensed with that sweet fruit vibe from your womb drop, yeet  
fruit of thy womb: on me the curse slid sideways like an unwanted emoji, full kek mode, omg  
glanced on the ground; with hustle mode on i gotta earn my bread, yeeting for that drip, no cap  
my bread; what harm? idleness was the ultimate cringe, worse than any lag or ghosted update, deadass  
my labor will sustain me; and, so we ain’t gettin’ iced or roasted by the temps, fr fr stayin’ fire  
or heat should injure us, his timely care dropped like a life hack, turning any cold or hot glitch into chill vibes, period  
hath, unbesought, come through and his hands wrapped us in that free drip, pure clout mode, omg  
clothed us unworthy, pitying while he dished out judge vibes without any salt, just pure megachad love  
how much more, if we slide into his prayers, will his ear stay wide open like a vintage vinyl on repeat, deadass  
be open, and his heart be flexing pity mode, hyped for our contrite feels like the ultimate rescue meme, yo  
and school us on how to dodge those savage inclement seasons, pro tip noob style, like avoiding toxic lag energy  
the inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow! full meteor meltdown vibes, skrrt on god  
which now the sky, flexing various facades, starts showing its chaotic mood on this mountain, pure art of glitch  
to show us in this mountain; while the winds be blowin’ moist fire, chaotic af like a DPS spam in discord  
blowin’ moist and keen, shattering those graceful locks like a surprise keysmash in a live stream, big yikes  
of these fair, vibin’ trees spreadin’ like epic backgrounds; telling us to snag a dope shroud or better warmth, fr  
some better shroud, some rad warmth to cherish our benummed limbs, gotta save that energy before the night drops cold  
our limbs benummed, before this diurnal star yeets the cold night away, no cap, must upgrade our vibe  
leave the night cold, so that his gathered beams reflect with matter sere and melt the frost, straight-up yeet  
reflected, may with matter sere foment, like prepping a lit reactor meltdown that’s peak chaos, omg  
or, by collision of two bodies, grind the air into fire like a clumsy rave turning to epic sparks, deadass  
the air gettin’ attrite to fire; as late the clouds started flexing, jigglin’ like unstable memes in a server crash  
justling, or pushed by winds, rude af in their shock, like glitchy dubs dropping savage keysmashes, oof  
tine the slant lightning; whose thwart flames, driven down like epic fail sparks that ignite dank energy, on god  
kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine; straight-up sparking that forest snack like a retro nyan cat jump, lol  
and sends a cozy bomb heat from afar, legit substituting for the sun’s clout, big mood  
which might even flex as a sun-supply if you’re tryna melt those cold vibes, pure fire to use, skrrt  
and what else is the hack or remedy to counter the evils our own misdeeds spawned, full cringe, deadass  
to evils our own missteps wrought, dank curses on loop, big yikes, fam  
he gonna instruct us while we spam our prayers and vibe-hustle, sprinkling grace like free loot drops, period  
beseeching him; so we ain’t gotta fear cruising through this life like a laggy stream, upgrade secured  
to pass this life all comfy, sustained by his epic patch of comforts till we end up dust, our final rest crib  
in dust, our final chill spot and native home, where we log out as OG memes, deadass  
what better can we do than haul ourselves to that spot where he dissed us, our ancient judgment ground, no cap  
repairin’ where he judged us, we straight-up prostrate-fall like beta users before his divine update, yeet  
before him, super reverent; and there we confess our epic fails and spill our tea on every glitch, oof  
humbly owning our faults and beggin’ pardon; our tears droppin’ like lag spikes in a broken stream, sad but lit  
watering the ground with drip-tears, our sighs saturating the air like a viral sad boi soundtrack, fr fr  
flooding the air, sent from hearts real contrite, a sign of unfeigned sorrow and mega humble roast, deadass  
of pure, unfeigned sorrow and meek humiliation, the ultimate cringe votes, big yikes, real talk  

undoubtedly, he gonna relent and flip his mood, turning his displeasure from full anger to chill, on god  
from his dis, in that serene, cloudfree look, pure chill mode with no cap, mega zen  
when he was angsty and super severe, full ghost mode activated, but then only favour, grace, and mercy shone like epic loot drops  
so spake our father in full penitent mode; even eve caught that remorse drip, no cap  
eve felt the same deep remorse: they bounced straight to that judgment spot, prostrate and falling in awe, yeet  
before him, mad reverent; and both came clean confessing every glitch and beggin’ pardon with teary drip, oof  
humbly owning their faults and begging pardon; their tears watering the ground like a sad viral challenge, big yikes  
watering down the earth, and their heavy sighs filling the air like a slow meme loop from contrite hearts, fr  
flooding the space with genuine feels, a sign of unfeigned sorrow and meek humiliation, pure beta energy

thus they, in lowliest plight, stood repentant like total scrubs in a deep glitch of feels, yeeted in prayer mode  
praying; cuz from the mercy-seat up above, grace dropped like a surprise loot crate, pure viral energy, deadass  
prevenient grace swooped down and booted out the stone vibes from their hearts, like clearing a busted server cache, fr

inspired and winged heavenbound on wings faster than any clout-chasing oratory flex, skrrt asap  
than the loudest oratory; yet their petition wasn’t from low-tier suitors but served epic clout, deadass  
not from some mean, basic suitors; their petition was lit, no less important than ancient duo vibes  
seemed as fire as when that ancient pair, deucalion and chaste pyrrha, dropped old-school restoration vibes, fr  
in those old fables—less ancient than these wild days—deucalion and chaste pyrrha came to restore the drowned humanity, oof  
the human race, totally drowned out, before the shrine of themis where the OG judge stood devout, no cap  
to heaven their prayers yeeted upward, not missing the way through envious wind trolls, fr fr

which his own hand could’ve manured out across all the trees of paradise before innocence got ghosted, smh  
from innocence. so now, bend your ear, fam, and tune into our supplication vibe  
hear his heavy sighs even if they’re mute, raw feels still streaming, no cap  
i might be a little unskilled with pray words so let me decode his vibe for him, vroom vroom  
i’m his advocate and propitiation, his ultimate hype man, real talk  
and all his works—good or bad—are ingrafted on me, turning my merit into epic bonus points, deadass  
those merits perfect the deal, and for ‘em, my death is the ultimate payment, a sacrificial dust-up, oof

for dissolution wrought by sin, that original epic fail that first glitched all things, big yikes  
that first distempered everything, turning incorrupt into a full meltdown remix, fr fr  
corrupted. i, at first, blessed him with two flawless starter gifts, dual drops of epic grace, deadass  
created him endowed with pure happiness, a vibe so lit it was peak fire, on god  
and immortality, though that fire got fondly lost—like a forgotten meme in the archives, oof  
this other gift only served to eternize the woe, turning life into a perpetual cringe loop, big yikes  
till i dropped death like the final patch: so death becomes the ultimate remedy, the final fix, fr fr

and in their state, even though they looked firm, they got extra confirmed as total cringe, fr  
he wrapped it up, and the son dropped a high signal, pressing that emergency “yeet” button, lol  
to the bright minister on watch; he blew his trumpet full blast, like a skibidi alert in oreb, on god  
his trumpet echoed since god first descended for that epic drop—and maybe will again for general doom, fr fr  
to sound off at general doom, the angelic blast filled every region like a viral alarm, off the chain, omg  
filling all spaces: from blissful hidey-holes of amarantine shade, fountain, or spring of pure life vibe, deadass  
by the waters of life, wherever they chilled in epic squad fellowships, joy mode activated, on god

o sons, like man turned into one of us, leveling up to know both good and evil since he snacked on that defended fruit, big brain drip  
but let him brag about his knowledge of good lost and evil caught—happier had it been enough to just know pure good and skip evil entirely, real talk  

now he’s sorrowing, repenting, and praying all contrite, deep feels on loop, more lasting than his fleeting moves, on god  
i know his heart’s variable and vain, like a tiktok challenge that flips every second, self-left and sus, oof  
lest his bolder hand reaches for the tree of life to chow down and secure eternal clout, mega oof  
and live forever, or at least dream of never logging off—so to stop that eternal glitch, i decree  
i’m sending him from the garden out to till that ground whence he was booted, into fresher, fitter soil, upgrade required, deadass  
michael, yo, this my behest—you in charge, so scoop from among the cherubim your top pick of flaming warriors, heavy fire mode activated, yeet

boot out the unholy from that hallowed ground; denounce them and their whole progeny with perpetual banishment, ghost them forever, oof  
perpetual banishment. yet, so they don’t faint under the weight of this sad, rigorous sentence—i peep them softening, tears streaming over their excess, big feels, lol  
if they obey your patient bidding, don’t leave ‘em disconsolate; drop the future deets to adam, spill the tea on what’s comin’, on god  
reveal to adam what future days hold—as i enlighten you; intermix my covenant into the woman’s renewed seed, next-gen firmware for humanity, fr fr  
so send them forth, even if sorrowful, let ‘em bounce in peace, real chill departure vibes

guarding all passage to that tree so no foul spirit can sneak in and turn my trees into their snack stash to delude man back into the glitch, big yikes, fr  

he ceased; and the arch-angelic power got prepped for a swift dive bomb—full descent mode activated, deadass  
with him came the bright squad of watchful cherubim, the ultimate lit crew

all their shapes spangled with eyes more numerous than argus ever had on deck, serious multi-eye drip, on god  
and more wakeful than to snooze—mad alert like a discord mod on an all-nighter, fr  
they were charmed with some arcadian pipe vibes, that pastoral reed remix like hermes on a vape, oof  
meanwhile, to re-salute the world with that sacred glow, pure divine neon, leuckothea woke up and dripped fresh dews to give the earth a skincare glow-up, legit  
when adam and the original matron eve wrapped up their orisons, they scored extra strength from above, new hope springing from despair like a spring break miracle, yeet  
joy exploded, albeit linked with a side of fear—bittersweet drip, on god  
which is how he dropped his welcome words to eve, renewing her vibe in pure heartfelt mode, deadass  
eve, just admit my faith: all the lit goodness we snag from heaven straight descends, no cap  
but for anything from us to ascend to heaven so hard it messes with god’s high-blessed mind or tilts his will—that’s wild to believe, yet a single prayer or even one short human sigh can ride up to god’s seat, fr  
i kneeled and poured out my whole heart to appease that offended deity, humbling myself full send, on god  
i swear i saw him all placable and mild, bending his ear like he was tuning into my desperate vibe, and my persuasion grew like trending topics on tiktok, real talk  
i felt i was heard with mad favour; peace slid back into my chest, that promise locked into my memory like a viral pledge—your seed will bruise our foe, straight up, no cap  
which, even if not noticed in a past dismay, reassures me that the bitterness of death is already cancelled, and we shall live, so hail to thee, eve, rightly called the mother of all mankind  
mother of all living things, since through you, man gets to live; and all things vibe for man, epic lifecycle mode, fr  
to whom eve, with that sad, meek vibe, delivered the final tea in ultimate humility, deadass

yo, i ain’t even worthy of that title, deadass no cap cuz i’m the transgressor who got ordained as your “helper” but ended up as your snare, big yikes—meant for reproach and mad shade, distrust, and all that dispraise sauce; but fr fr, my judge be infinite in pardon, so even though i was the one who first dropped death on everyone, i’m now graced as the source of life, the ultimate drip. and then you, totally fav, highkey leveled me up with a dope title that’s way beyond any other name—genius flex, no cap. but yo, the grind calls us now with sweat on deck, even after that sleepless all-nighter; ‘cause peep it—the morn slides in all unconcerned with our drama, glowing in rosy progress and smiling like “let’s yeet out there ya bish.” i’m swearin’ on my vibe, i’ll never stray from your side, no matter how laborious our daily hustle gets, from now till day droop, while here we chill—these pleasant strolls ain’t even toilsome in our fallen state, we stay content, period.

so spake, so wished much humbled eve—but fate ain’t subscribing, fr fr—nature first dropped the signs, all glitched out on bird, beast, air, then air got eclipsed out of nowhere after a short blush of morn; and like, almost in her view, jupiter’s bird, lowkey stooped from its dope aery tour, had two extra squad birds with the gayest plumage cruising ahead; next, down from a hill, the woods’ reigning beast, first on hunter mode then switching up, pursued a gentle duo—the forest’s most aesthetic pair, hart and hind—straight flexing their flight toward the eastern gate like it’s destined.

adam peeped the chase with his streaming eye and, not unmoved by the wild tea, slid into eve’s dms: yo eve, brace up ‘cause some further change is coming hard, like, heaven’s serving up mute nature signals as the forerunner of his plan—or to warn us, in case we’re too secure and about to get yeeted from penalty-free mode, ‘cause like, maybe we’re just dust destined to bounce back to dust, deadass. i mean, why else you see this double-objective drip: a flight in the air and over the ground at the same clock? why is it that in the east, darkness be dropping pre-mid-course, while morning-light flexes mad orient vibes on a western cloud drawing a radiant white on the blue firmament and slowly descending with some heavenly load? he wasn’t glitching, fam; by these moves the heavenly squad, fresh outta a jasper-sky paradise and halting on a hill, popped up as a dope apparition that left no doubt and left adam with a carnal fear dimming his eye.

not even as lit as when the angels rolled up to meet jacob in mahananaim, where he peeped the field decked out with his bright guardians, nor like that fire-camp stunt on the flaming mount in dothan against the syrian king who went full assassin on one dude in a surprise war that was unproclaimed, yo. the princely hierarch pulled his powers in that shiny stand to snatch possession of the garden, cruising solo to find where adam was hiding, and adam, lowkey observant, hit up eve while the great visitor was on the approach:

yo eve, now expect some massive tea that might soon decide our whole vibe or slap new laws on us; ‘cause i’m scoping out from that blazing cloud over the hill one of the heavenly hosts—none of the basic, mean NPCs, but some major potentate or one of those supreme thrones types, coming in with such majesty it’s lit! yet not so terrorizing that i should catch mad fear, nor as soft as raphael where i’d spill all the deets—instead, he’s solemn and sublime, the type you don’t wanna offend, so with mad reverence i gotta dip while you chill aside.

and then he dipped out—next up, the arch-angel rolled in, not in full celestial glow but as a dude, cladded to meet man; over his lit-up arms dripped a military vest in purple so vibrant it outshined meliboean or sarra’s grind, that epic drip worn by kings and old-school heroes in truce times—iris had dipped that bomber starry helm unbuckled to show he was prime in manhood where youth already clocked out; and by his side, like a glistering zodiac flex, dang, hung satan’s dire dread, his sword of absolute terror, and in his hand, the spear, straight savage energy.

adam bowed low in that kingly state, letting his vibe broadcast: adam, heaven’s high behest don’t need no preface—your prayers got logged, and death, which was due when you trashed our rules, got totally defeated for mad days, giving you grace time to repent, cover one bad act with a bang of good deeds, word—to the point that your lord can totally redeem you from death’s rapacious claim; but yo, staying longer in this paradise ain’t in the plan—i’m here to yeet you out and send you from the garden to till that ground you were snatched from, to a soil that’s, like, more fit.

adam caught the news and froze, heart-struck with that chilly, grim vibe that bound all his senses; while eve, lowkey listening in on every bit of it, let out an audible lament which soon revealed the spot of her retreat: oh, unexpected sucker punch worse than death itself—must i really leave you paradise? leave you, my native turf? these dank walks and godly shades, the perfect haunt of gods where i had mad hopes to chill in a quiet though sad respite, that one day which is gonna be mortal for both of us. oh flowers, never gonna grow in any other climate, my first hang and my last even, which i nurtured with tender care from the first bud pop and gave y’all names—now who’s gonna rear you to the sun or rank your tribes and water you from that ambrosial fountain? and lastly, nuptial bower, adorned by me with the sweetest vibes ever—how the heck do i part from you and where do i wander down into a lower world; into this obscure and wild zone where we gotta breathe air that’s less pure than the immortal fruits we were used to?

then the angel cut in, all chill and mild: yo, don’t lament, eve, just resign patiently to what you’ve rightfully lost, and don’t get over-fond over stuff that ain’t yours—your leaving ain’t a solo exit; your husband’s ride tags along and where he hangs is basically your native turf.

adam, slowly shaking off that cold sudden damp vibe and gathering his scattered spirit, hit up michael with humble words: celestial dude, whether you’re chillin’ among the thrones or even rockin’ the highest crown of them all (because that shape gives you major prince above princes energy), you delivered your message so gently that it wouldn’t wound or end us—beyond sorrow, dejection, and despair that our fragile vibe can handle, your tidings be telling us to bounce from this happy chill zone, our sweet recess, which is our only consolation left for our eyes; every other place is like inhospitable, desolate, don’t vibe with us, and if i could pray incessantly to twist the will of the big boss who controls all things, i’d never stop bombarding him with my assiduous cries—but prayer against his absolute decree is as weak as breath against wind blowing that breath back at its source, so i submit to his grand bidding.

this whole setup hits me hard ‘cause leaving here means i’ll get hidden from his blessed mug, robbed of that divine presence; here, i could totally hit up every worship spot he graced with his presence and spill to my sons, “yo, he showed up on this mount, under this tree, among these pines i caught his voice, and we even chopped it up at this fountain,” so many dank altars i’d build outta grassy turf, stacking up every shiny stone from the brook as a memorial or monument to the ages—and offer sweet-smelling gums, fruits, and flowers. but in that other nether world, where the heck do i find his bright appearances or track his footsteps? even though i ran from him in an angry meltdown, i now recall the extended life promise and lowkey adore even his outermost skirts of glory, far off, his steps be pure adoration.

to which michael chimed in, all kind vibes: adam, you know heaven’s his, and all the earth—this ain’t just about this rock; his omnipresence fills land, sea, air, and every living creature, all amped up by his virtual power and warm energy. he gave you the whole earth to rule, a gift that’s anything but despicable; so don’t imagine his vibe’s confined to these tight paradise or eden bounds—this might have been your capital seat from which all generations spread, with peeps coming from every end of the earth to celebrate and revere you as their ultimate progenitor.

but this mega pre-eminence you lost got you down to dwell on even ground with your sons; yet don’t doubt that whether in valley or plain, god is still here and you’ll catch many signs of his presence, circling you with goodness and paternal love, his vibe clearly expressing and his steps leaving that divine track. so let this be something you truly believe—and get confirmed before you dip—know that i was sent to show you what’s coming for you and your offspring: expect the mix of good with bad, that supernal grace duking it out with human sin, teaching you true patience and how to temper joy with fear and that pious sorrow, so you can be equally prepped to bear any state, prosperous or adverse; that way you lead your life safest and best prepared to endure your mortal passage whenever it drops.

and then, yo, ascend this hill; let eve crash here (i totally drenched her eyes) and sleep below while you stay woke to foresight—like back when you crashed and she was just gettin’ formed into life.

adam, in full gratitude mode, hit back: ascend, i’m followin’ you, my safe guide; i’m down the path you lead and submitting to heaven’s hand, however harsh the chastening may be—turnin’ my obvious chest toward the evil turn and gearing up to overcome by sufferin’ so i can earn rest from that hard-won grind, if that’s even in the cards. so both ascended, riding those visions of god. it was a hill, the highest of paradise; from its top, the hemisphere of earth stretched out in the clearest, most epic perspective, reaching the amplest expanse—no hill higher, no lookin’ round wider—where, for some sus reason, the tempter set our second adam in the wilderness to show him all of earth’s kingdoms and their glory. his eye could command wherever either old-school city or modern fame stood, the very seat of the mightiest empire, from the destined walls of cambalu, the seat of cathaian can, and samarchand by oxus, temir’s throne.

yo shoutout to paquin of sinaean kings; and thence, deadass to agra and lahor of that mega mogul drip, yo down to the golden chersonese, or wherex the persian in ecbatan was posted, or since in hispahan, or wherex the russian ksar in moscow be flexin’, or the sultan in bizance, turchestan-born af, and his eye was like “nah bro, i can’t even ken” the empire of negus to its utmoast port ercoco, and then the low-key maritim kings mombaza, quiloa, and melind – big yikes, fr fr!

yo then sofala, thought ophir, serving up the realm of congo and angola way down south – or from that niger flood to atlas mount, yeeted in the kingdoms of almansor, fez and sus, morocco, and algiers, and tremisen on europe, and where rome was supposed to run the whole world flex, deadass spirit vibes saw rich mexico, the seat of montezume, and cusco in peru, the lux seat of atabalipa; and still unspoiled guiana, whose huge city geryon’s sons call that el dorado drip. 

but to nobler sights, michael slid in from adam’s peepers like “bye bye film,” scrubbing off that bogus fruit filter that promised clearer vision but delivered sus vibes; then he purged it with euphrasy and rue like a glitch purge on his visual nerve ‘cause my guy had sooo much to see, and dripped in three life drops from the well of life, so deep those ingredients pierced right to the core mental seat—adam got forced to shut his eyes, sunk down, and all his spirit npcs went into trance mode; but then the gentle angel grabbed his hand, raising him up lickety-split and calling him back: “adam, now ope thine eyes, fam; peep the effects of thy original crime, the glitch that spawned some from thee who never touched that excepted tree nor joined the snake conspiracy, no sin on their sin—but still from that sin came raw corruption to spice up more wild deeds.”

his eyes popped open and he peeped a field, yo – part arable and tilth with freshly reaped sheaves, and the other part all sheep-walk vibes and folds; deadass in the midst, an altar stood like a rustic landmark of grassy sord, and then boom—a sweaty reaper from his grind brought in first fruits, the green ear and yellow sheaf, unculled ‘cause they just came to hand; next up, a chill shepherd rolled in with the firstlings of his flock, choicest and best, and then sacrificed the insides and their fat, strewed with incense on the cleft wood as all due rights went off: his offering got lit by a fire from heaven, yaaaas consumed with a nimble glance and grateful steam, while the other man’s offer was all sus and half-assed, making him rage hard and, while they were chatting susly, he smote him right in the midriff with a stone that yeeted out his life—he fell, deadly pale, groaning out his soul with a straight-up blood gush.

adam was shook so hard at that sight in his heart, dismayed like a total noob, and he hollered fast at the angel, “o teacher, some mega mischief just hit that meek dude who sacrificed his vibes—like, is piety and pure devotion even paid up like that?” michael then dropped the tea: “these two are brethren, adam, and gonna pop outta thy loins; the unjust smote the just ‘cause his brother’s offering got heaven’s upvote, but yo, the bloody fact is gonna be avenged, and the other’s faith, legit approved, won’t lose its reward—even if you see him dyin’, rollin’ in dust and gore.” to which our sire goes “alas! both for the deed and the cause, fr fr! but have i now seen death? is this the mood where i must bounce back to native dust? o sight of terror, so foul and ugly to behold, horrid to think and feel – like, major cringe!”

michael then clapped back, “death, my dude, you peeped it in its first shape on man, but there are mad shapes of death and oodles of dank ways that lead to its grim cave, all dismal af; yet the entrance is even more terrifying than inside. some, as you peeped, gonna get yeeted by a violent stroke; by fire, flood, famine, and mad intemperance in meats and drinks that bring dire diseases – unleashing a monstrous crew to show you what misery the inabstinence of eve is about for men.”

immediately, a place popped before his eyes, all sad, noisome, and dark – like a straight-up lazar-house where numbers of all the diseased were laid out, with all the ghastly spasm maladies, racking torture, heart-sick agony qualms, feverish vibes, convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs, intestine stones and ulcers, colick-pangs, demoniack phrenzy, moaping meltdown melancholy, and moon-struck madness with pining atrophy, marasmus, and massive pestilence, dropsies, asthmas, and joint-racking rheums – pure chaos, bro. the tossin’ was dire, with deep groans, and despair was hustlin’ the sick from couch to couch; over them, triumphant death shook his dart but kept it on ice, even though they kept invoking him with vows as their final hope. a sight so deformed, not even a heart of rock could dry-eyed peep it—adam couldn’t help but weep, not born of woman but pure compassion, until his best man feelings brought him to tears, then firmer thoughts reined in the excess; barely catching his words, he renewed his plaint like a nonstop rant.

o miserable mankind, what a fall you got—degraded, wretched, and reserved for total meltdown! better to have never been born, deadass. why’s life even given to be wrested from us? like, why force us with this load? who, if they knew what’s up, wouldn’t just yeet life away or beg to lay it down, glad to be dismissed in total peace? can the image of god in man, once created so goodly and erect even if he’s been glitching since, really be debased into such unsightly suffering under inhuman pains? why shouldn’t man—still retaining some divine drip in parts—be free from these deformities and exempt for the sake of his maker’s image? michael claps back: “their maker’s image bounced when they got busy vying for ungoverned appetite; they swapped his light for a brutish vice, feeding straight into eve’s sin.” therefore, so abject is their punishment, disfiguring not god’s likeness but just their own, or if his likeness got defaced by themselves, while they twisted nature’s healthful rules into loathsome sickness – all ‘cause they didn’t respect god’s image inside them.” adam’s like, “i yield it just, and im submit.”

but yo, is there no other way besides these painful passages on how we end up dead and mixed with our own dust? there is, said michael, if thou peep the rule of “not too much” – that temperance drip in what you eat and drink; snagging that due nourishment but not falling into gluttonous delight, until years stack over your head; so you live, until like a ripe fruit you drop into your mother’s lap, or be gathered chill with ease, not harshly plucked, when death finally matures: this is old age, but then you must outlive your youth, strength, and beauty which all turn into withered, weak, gray vibes; your senses become obtuse, no longer tasting pleasure, holding onto what you have; and for that air of youth, which once was hopeful and cheerful in your blood, a damp, cold and dry melancholy will weigh your spirit down, slowly consuming the balm of life. facts on facts, our ancestor vibes hard.

henceforth i ain’t runnin’ from death, nor would i prolong life much; i’m bent on ditchin’ this cumbrous charge as easily as possible, till my appointed day of check-out and patiently attendin’ my own dissolution. michael then hit back, “nor love thy life, nor hate it; just live well, however long or short, and permit it to heaven—then prep for another wild sight.”

he peeped and saw a spacious plain, where tents of all kinds of hues were poppin’ off; some had herds of cattle chillin’, others vibin’ with instrument sounds that made mad melodic chime—harp and organ tunes on full flex—and whoever was movin’ those stops and chords had that volant touch, with instinct runnin’ through all proportions, low and high, dashing across a resonant fugue like it’s a tiktok trend.

on another part, one dude was at the forge, laboring hard, melting two huge clods of iron and brass – whether popped from a casual fire wreckin’ woods on a mountain or deep in a vale, down in the veins of earth, then gliding hot to some cave’s mouth, or even washed by a stream from underground, idk – and drained that liquid ore into fit moulds like a pro, from which he first molded his own tools; then, anything else could be fusil-ed or graven in metal. after that, on the hither side, a different crew descended from the high neighboring hills – their seat – straight down to the plain; by the looks, they were just dudes, all about worshipping god right and peeping his works, nothing hidden; nor those lastin’ things that keep freedom and peace for men; they’d barely strolled the plain when, yo, from the tents popped out a bevy of fair women, drippin’ in gems and wild, wanton dresses, singing soft amorous ditties on the harp and jumpin’ into dance like total vibe queens.

the men, though serious af, couldn’t help but let their eyes roam free; caught in that amorous net fast, they picked favorites and each chose his vibe; then love got lit until the evening-star, love’s harbinger, appeared; all in one heated rush, they lit the nuptial torch and summoned hymen, kickin’ off the marriage rites with a feast and musick that had all the tents boomin’. such a lit meetup, a fair event of love and youth not lost—songs, garlands, flowers, and charming symphonies slapping the heart of adam, who soon got down to admitting delight, the natural bent of his vibe; and he expressed, “true opener of mine eyes, prime angel blest; this vision’s far better and brings more hope for some peaceful days than the past hate and death, or even worse pain; here nature’s fully on point in all her ends.”

and michael then wrapped it up, “judge not what’s best by mere pleasure, even if it seems nature-approved; created as thou art to a nobler end—holy, pure, and divinely conformin’. those tents you saw, so pleasant, were actually tents of wickedness, where his race who slew their own brother now dwells; they come off studious in arts that shine up life, rare inventors, but totally unmindful of their maker even though his spirit schooled them – they acknowledged none of his gifts.”

yo, these epic offspring boutta be spawned deadass no cap fr;  
cuz that fine babe crew u peeped lookin' like straight up goddess squad all chill and smooth on god,  
but lowkey empty af where all that real vibe’s supposed to chill, like the old-school domestic rep ghosted, lol;  
bred up solely and finished like ur fave meme mix for that savage lust drip to sing, dance, flex, and troll the tongue while rollin’ eyes like meme reactions, yeet;  
for these sober dude squad, tagged as god’s homies by the church squad, gonna yeet all their pure clout and virtue into the dank meme train of those fine atheist peeps flashing cheeky smirks, now they swim in joy, soon free floatin’ and laughin’ so hard the earth’s cryin’ salty tears, legit;  
adam, low on vibes and short on joy, is like “omg, messed up feels,” deadass;  
big pity n mad shame that those who had that lit entrance to good livin’ ended up takin’ off on sus detours, ridin’ side paths that are totally indirect or mid-way faint, major L fr;  
still, i peep the raw, endless drama of mankind’s woe that all started with that womxn chaos since day one on god,  
as the angel—flexin’ mad wisdom and superior gifts—spills that this whole mess kicked off with man’s extra soft, effeminate slack energy, no cap;  
but yo, buckle up fam for another scene, wild af and yeeted outta the box!

dude peeped a vast, savage map unfurlin’ right before him with towns and country chaos in the mix;  
cities of men flexin’ high-key gates and towers, and soldiers in arms with fierce mug shots ready to throw down war vibes, giant gigachads of massive bone and bold moves goin’ all in, legit;  
some peeps be brandishin’ their arms whilst others be chillin’ by tamin’ that foamy steed, whether solo or squad up in battle on horse or on foot, none standin’ idly like basic npcs, deadass;  
on one side, a lit band picks off a herd of beefy cattle—oxen and kine straight out of a chonky meadow—and a fleecy flock of sheep with bleatin’ lambs across the plain, snaggin’ that booty like dairy drip, lowkey;  
shepherds barely holdin’ their own, callin’ in backup that sparks a brutal, savage fray, chaos overload, big yikes;  
in a cruel tourney vibe, squads unite and turn what used to be chill cattle pastures into carcass central with slick arms and a blood-soaked field left deserted, fr;  
then other crews lay siege to a stronghold city, encamped with battery moods, scaling the walls with mined-up energy and assaulting like wild, while defenders on the wall toss darts, javelins, stones, and lit sulphurous fire in a full-on meme war riot, no chill;  
all-out mass slaughter and gigantick deeds rain down on both ends, pure chaotic blood vibes, savage af.

elsewhere, crowned heralds holler up the council at the city gates; next, a crew of graybeard wise dudes mixed with hardcore warriors roll in, droppin’ mad harangues in a heated rager until one midlife legend steps up droppin’ truth bombs on right and wrong, spittin’ on justice, religion, truth, peace, and divine judgement—both old heads and young exploded in frenzy, grabbin’ him with wild violent hands, if not for a cloud swoopin’ in to snatch him unseen from the throng, so that chaos—violence, oppression, and sword-law—spread all over the plain with nowhere to hide, pure glitch mode.

adam was straight-up cryin’ buckets, full on tears, leanin’ on his guide in total sad mode, mumblin’ like “oh man, wut r these? death’s own minions, not real dudes, dealin’ death inhumanly and crankin’ the sin up ten thousandfold for that bro-slay drama—only their own kin got wrecked, classic betrayal vibes;”  
but then who was that one righteous dude, not rescued by heaven, left lost in his own virtue? then michael drops the tea:  
“yo, these are the wild products of those sus, ill-mated marriages u peeped—where the dope met the lame, even though neither was down for joinin’, but by stupid mix-up spawned monstrous, prodigious births in body and mind, on god.”  

these giants were the absolute legends, high-key renowned as the only ones admired back in the day—valor and hero vibes so epic for conquering battles, subduing whole nations, and bringin’ home infinite man-slayin’ spoils that scored the ultimate human glory; hailed as great conquerors, patrons of mankind, gods and even sons of gods, basically dubbed the destroyers and plagues of men, no cap;  
thus, mad fame and renown got locked in on earth, while the dopest merits of fame stayed lowkey hidden in silence, hella mysterious.

but then there’s that seventh dude you saw—the only righteous one in this messed-up world—hatred and foes swarming him for straight-up bein’ just and droppin’ that odious truth that god himself is comin’ with his saint squad to judge all the haters; the most high scooped him up in a balmy cloud with fly winged steeds and took him to walk with god in high salvation and bliss, totally exempt from death, showin’ what sweet reward the good snag and what punishment awaits the rest—peep it soon, deadass.

he looked and peeped that everything had switched up; war’s brazen throat had ghosted its savage roar and the scene flipped to full-on jollity and game mode, luxury, riot, epic feasts, and dance-offs; folks were marriagin’ or hustlin’ on the street, droppin’ into rap, adultery, wherever that passing beauty seduced ‘em—coppin’ cups straight into civil brawls, wild chaos everywhere.

eventually, a reverend sire rolled in among them, throwin’ major shade at their messed-up actions and testifying hard against their ways; he used to crash their assemblies—triumphs, festivals, you name it—and preach conversion and repentance like savin’ souls locked up under imminent judgment, but when he peeped how everythin’ was doomed, he bailed and yeeted his tents far away, no cap.

then from the mountain, hackin’ tall timber, he started buildin’ a colossal vessel—a beast of an ark measured by cubits, length, and breadth, all lathered in pitch, with a dope door rigged on the side and provisions loaded up massive for both humans and critters, fr;  
and then, omg, behold a crazy wonder—every beast, bird, and small insect rolled in in sevens and pairs, lined up perfectly like a flawless order, and last the sire with his three sons and their four wives hopped in, and god slammed that door shut like a boss.

meanwhile, the south-wind popped off, with black-winged vibes hoverin’ wide, herdin’ all the clouds from under heaven; the hills got all their vapor and moody dusk vibes pumped hard, while the thick sky set up like a dark ceiling and rain just smashed down impetuously day and night until the earth was ghosted; the giant floating vessel, secure with a beaked prow, rode and tilted over wild waves as every other crib got flooded and rolled deep underwater with all their pomp—sea on sea without any shore—and in their once-luxurious palaces, sea monsters spawned and set up crib, and practically all of mankind got squashed into one tiny bottom in the ark, pure utter chaos, lol.

so, how you grieved then, adam, watchin’ all your kin vanish in such a tragic depopulation? another mega flood of tears and sorrow drowned you too, sinkin’ you like your sons, until the angel gently hoisted you up to stand on your own, though comfortless like a father mourning all his kids wiped out at once—you barely dropped your sad cry to the angel, omg what a mess.

oh, those visions were ill foreseen—i wish i’d stayed clueless about the future, cuz each day’s evil baggage was enough trauma on its own; and those who got slammed with the weight of ages ‘cause of my doomed foreknowledge were born abortive to torment me before they even truly were—yo, let nobody try to predict their fate, for no matter the warning, evil’s gonna hit hard in both mind and matter, brutal to bear; but that stress is long gone, man ain’t worth warnin—only a few who dodged famine and anguish will eventually get consumed, wanderin’ that watery desert; i had hope when violence ditched and war bounced off earth, thinkin’ peace would crown mankind with endless happy days, but i got played hard, ‘cause now even peace is corruptin’ just as much as war wrecks, fr.

how it is, then? spill it, celestial guide—tell me if here the race of man is done. then michael’s like, “yo, those peeps you last saw in triumph and luxurious drip, known for epic prowess and grand exploits but totally void of true virtue—they spilled mad blood and crushed nations for fame, high titles, and riches, but soon flipped their course to pure pleasure, ease, sloth, and overindulgence, until wild wantonness and pride sparked hostile moves even in peace.”  

the defeated, enslaved by war, gonna lose their freedom, their virtue, and that fear of god; their phony piety never held up in battle against invaders, so they cooled their zeal and learned to live safe in whatever scraps their lords left for them—since the earth yields more than enough to test temperance, everyone’s gonna turn degenerate and depraved, leavin’ justice, self-control, truth, and faith forgotten, lmao.

except one dude—the sole son of light in this dark af age—who stands as the real example against all temptations, customs, and a world full of offended npcs; fearless of hate, reproach, or violence, he calls out their wicked ways and sets before them the righteous path piled with safety and peace, denouncing the wrath to come on their stubborn sin, even though he gets roasted, god still peeps him as the one just man alive; by his command, he builds a wondrous ark, as u saw, to save himself and his household from a world doomed to universal wreck, deadass.

no sooner does he, with his handpicked crew of homies and wild beasts, get cozy in the ark and sheltered in tight, than every heavenly waterfall—like total cataracts—pours rain nonstop day and night; all the deep fountains burst up, heaving the ocean past all bounds until the flood rises over the highest hills; then the mount of paradise gets yeeted right outta its spot by savage waves, pushed by that horned flood, with all its lush vibe spoiled and trees driftin’ down the giant river to the gulf, where a salty, barren island takes root—a haunt for seals, orcs, and the clanging of sea-mews—to show you that god assigns mad significance to place.

no sanctity deadass if nobody drags that spot full of npc wannabes who slide through 24/7 vibes, yo  
by men who be chillin there or lowkey livin in that joint, fr fr  
and now, behold the drip of what’s next, like, get ready for the chaos lol  
he peeped that ark, yeeted its hull on a flooded drip scene, no cap  
which had, like, totally dipped af since those clouds ghosted out, deadass  
blown away by a savage north wind, dry as heck, skrrt wrapping deluge’s face like old memes in decay, big yikes  
and the clear sun, blazing on his mega watery glass, looked all hot and flexed on that fresh wave, cuh  
pulling major thirst vibes as if it was chuggin’ liquid drip, making flows shrink from a chill lake to that tripping ebb, stealth mode activated  
creepin’ soft like a sneaky yeet toward the deep, then pausing his water swag when heaven clapped its windows shut like “nah bro”  
the ark ain’t floatin no mo, it’s parked hard on some high mountain like a glitch in gta, fixed and solid af  
and now, hilltops pop up like rocks, all stoney and raw, with rapid currents clamorously cruising toward the retreating sea in a furious tide, full send, no cap  
outta the ark, a raven yeets off quick, pure glitch in the matrix, and tailing that, the real messenger dove, sent on repeat to spy green trees or lit ground where its foot can land, fr for real  
round two, the dove slides back with an olive leaf in its bill, a pacifick sign that screams “peace out,” deadass  
boom—dry ground pops up, so the old sire dips from his ark with his whole squad, full train mode  
then, hands raised high like a twitch emote and eyes all devout, he thanks the big guy upstairs, peepin’ a dewy cloud with a rainbow bow flex, three lifted colours, extra and bright, signaling god’s peace vibes and a fresh covenant drop, legit  
adam’s heart, once so sad af, goes ballistic with joy and blasts out that epic feelgood moment, no cap  

o you, who can flex future deets like a heavenly tiktok guru, i’m revived by this last cosmic sight, super sure that man will keep livin, preserving all creatures and their seeds like a proper squad, on god  
i ain’t even bummed for a whole world of wicked sons destroyed, cuz i’m vibin’ hard for that one perfect, just dude—so ultra pure that god’s like “bet, i’ll raise a whole new world from him and yeet my anger to the curb,” fr fr  

but yo, what’s up with those lit coloured streaks in heaven, stretched out like god’s chilled forehead, appeased or maybe just acting as a flowery edge to bind the liquid skirts of that same watery cloud so it don’t dissolve and go all sprinkle-shower on earth, deadass?  
to whom the arch-angel, dextrously aimed, hollers back like “yo, i see that,” and god, all chill, drops his ire like a forgotten meme, even if he’s just late repenting man’s depraved drip, getting all heartgrief seeing the whole earth mad violent and every flesh out there corruptin’ its own way, yet still giving a pass when one just man’s grace shines bright enough to make him chill on blotting out mankind and instead drop a covenant to never flood the earth again, nor let the sea go cray beyond its bounds or rain turn the whole world into a drippy drown fest for man or beast—nope, instead, whenever god sends a cloud, he rockets up his triple-coloured bow as a reminder of that covenant, day and night, seed-time and harvest, summer heat and frosty old memes holding their grind until fire totally purges any new drip from heaven and earth where the truly just will forever dwell, real talk  

book xii

like, picture a dude on his noon journey, bated breath and full speed, and here our arch-angel pauses, mid-swish between a world wrecked and a world respawned, just in case adam slides in with some intermission, yo  
then, with a smooth transition glitch, new speech drops  

so u peeped one world startin’ and droppin’ like a cancelled stream, and man, like a sequel character, spawns from a fresh second stock  
you got mad more to see, but i peep that ur mortal sight is glitchin’ on divine objects too extra for human senses, so from now on i’ll spill the tea on what’s next—tune in and attend, fam  

this second human drop, still a few in the mix while the dread of past judgement keeps spirits shook and deitiy fear high, makes ‘em follow that just and right vibe, leading their lives and multiplying faster than trending vids—labouring on the soil to harvest dope crops like corn, wine, and oil, and from the herd or flock often sacrificing a bull, lamb, or kid with mountain-sized wine pours and sacred feasts, spending days in unblamed joy and chill peace with fams and tribes under old school papa rule  
until a proud heart boss emerges, not content with fair equality or the common state, arrogatin’ undeserved dominion over his bros and straight up dispossessin’ nature’s law and concord from the earth; hunting not beasts but men with war and hostile snare, rejecting any submission to his tyrant empire—so he gets dubbed a mighty hunter before the lord, flexin’ like he’s dissing heaven or claiming a second sovranty from rebellion, even though he slaps rebellion on others, deadass  

he rolls with a crew, all hyped with ambition to tyrannize, marching from eden toward the west and peepin’ a plain where a black, sticky bituminous gurge, like boiling ooze from underground—the mouth of hell—drips out; with bricks and that strange cement, they throw up a city and tower so high it tries to hit heaven, all to snag a name so they won’t be lost in foreign lands, regardless of a good or evil rep, no cap  

but god, who sometimes ghost-slides down to peep on men and roams their cribs to check their doings, comes down to scope out their city just before that tower blocks heaven vibes, and then, in pure derision mode, sets a wild spirit on their tongues to erase their native language and instead sow a jangling noise of words no one can decode—boom, a hideous gabble erupts, loud as heck among the builders, each callin’ out in a language that’s total static until everyone gets hoarse and ragin’, storming like they got roasted, while the vibes in heaven are straight up crackin’ up at that bizarre hubbub, resulting in a build so ridiculous it gets named “confusion” for real  

adam, all fatherly and pissed, be like “o execrable son, how you dare aspire above your bros, swiping authority that wasn’t even god-given! god only tossed us the keys over beast, fish, and fowl with absolute dominion as a donation, but man over man? nah, that title stays reserved for that human free vibe”  

but this usurper, so proud of his encroachment, isn’t stoppin’ at man—he’s tossing up his tower as a siege against god, totally defiant, making him a wretched man who’s gonna need to haul up some snack stash to feed himself and his rash army up there, where the thin air above the clouds will have his guts pining and starve him of breath, if not straight-up bread, lmfao  

to whom michael drops, “yo, u just abhor that son for stirring mad trouble in men’s quiet state, tryna subdue rational liberty; but know this, since your original slip, true liberty’s been lost—always paired with right reason like inseparable twins, no individual separatin’, and when reason in man gets all obscured or disobeyed by instant extra desires and upstart passions, they hijack the government from reason and reduce man to servitude, until he’s not free anymore. so because he lets these unworthy powers reign within over his free brain, god, in his just judgement, subjects him from the outside to violent lords who often snatch his outward freedom undeservedly—tyranny is a must, even if that gives no excuse to the tyrant,” no cap  

yet sometimes nations dip so low from virtue—the very essence of reason—so that nothing but justice and a fatal curse stick to them, stripping them of their outer liberty and totally losing their inner glow; just peep the irreverent son of the ark builder who, for dissing his own father, caught that heavy curse, a servile curse passed on to his vicious lineage, pure cringe vibes  

thus, this latter world, like the former, keeps sliding from bad to even wackier until god, totally done with their iniquities, yeets his presence out and averts his holy eyes, deciding to leave them to their own polluted, toxic ways—while he picks one peculiar nation from all the rest to be his MVP, a nation sprung from one faithful man, still chillin’ on the euphrates side, even if bred up in idol-worship, o, canst thou believe how stupidly grown men got while the patriarch was still vibing, having escaped the flood, choosing to ghost the living god and fall into worshipping their own wood and stone creations for gods! yet the most high god vouchsafes, through a wild vision from his father’s crib, to call his kin and fake gods into a land he’ll reveal, and from that dude he’ll raise a mighty nation, showering him with benedictions so fierce that in his seed, all nations get blessed; he obeys straight up, not knowing exactly which land but firm in his faith—i see him, but u can’t, with that wild belief as he leaves his gods, his crew, and his native soil, ur of chaldaea, crossing the ford to haran, trailing a cumbrous posse of herds, flocks, and mad servitude, not wandering broke but trusting all his wealth with god who called him in some unknown land, legit  

canaan he now snags; i peep his tents pitched around sechem and the dope neighboring plain of moreh—there, by promise, he scores a gift for his progeny of the entire land, from hameth northward down to the desart south (i call these names even if they’re still unvibed), from hermon east to the great western sea—mount hermon, that yonder sea spot; i point them out in prospect, on the shore mount carmel; here flows the double-founted stream, jordan, the true east limit, while his sons settle in senir, that long, ridgy stretch of hills, real solid  

peep this ponder: all the nations of the earth gonna be blessed through his seed—by that seed we mean your great deliverer who’s gonna bruise the serpent’s head, and i’ll spill more tea on that anon, plainlier revealed. this blessed patriarch, whom faithful abraham will call in due time, leaves behind a son and that son leaves a grandchild, all in the same faith, wisdom, and renown vibes; the grandchild, with his twelve amped-up sons, bounces from canaan to a land later dubbed egypt, sliced up by the river nile—check it, the nile flows out at seven mouths into the sea—where he comes to crash, invited by a younger son, for a sojourn in that legendary land, legit no cap.

yo so deadass back in those dark, famine-era days a son flexin’ his worthy deeds got leveled up to be the number two in pharaoh’s lame realm, then he yeeted his own life and left his squad to glow up into a full-on nation – legit epic upgrade, fr fr – while a sus next-gen king, tryna stop their viral overgrowth cuz his guest list was full of npcs, went all savage and made them slaves while clapping their baby dudes, big yikes style; then two divine bros (moses and aaron, straight up god’s homies sent to snatch his peeps from that bondage cringe) roll in with mad glory and booty loot to bring the squad back to that promised land, no cap

but first this lawless, mega-tyrant who dissed god’s drip and ghosted his message gets forced into a next-level meltdown by cray signs and dire judgements – rivers flipped to blood mode, frogs, lice, and flies invaded his palace like unwanted clout crashers, filling every corner of his crib while his cattle rotted like forgotten memes and his flesh got all botched like a busted update; meanwhile thunder mixed with hail and straight-up fire tore the egyptian sky, spinning and devouring everything in its glitchy path, and if it didn’t snatch your herbs or grains then a dark locust cloud swooped in to yeet all things green, leaving nothing but a blackout so thick it shadowed his whole domain for three full days – total touch grass nightmare – then, with one midnight stroke, all the egyptian firstborn got clocked, dead and done; with ten brutal wounds, that river-dragon finally tapped out and let his sojourners bounce, humbling his stubborn heart that stayed as frozen as extra hard ice post-thaw, while in a fit of rage chasing the dismissed crew the sea swallowed him and his host but then let them cruise on dry land, jammed between two crystal walls and shook by moses’ rod that split the scene so hard it left everyone divided until they hit their shore; such jaw-dropping power god drops on his sainted squad, complete with his angel riding upfront in a cloud and a pillar of fire (cloud by day, fire by night) to guide their wild journey while the obdurate king trails behind all night, only blocked by deep darkness till the morning watch, then through a fiery pillar and hazy cloud god pops in, glitching out their chariot-wheels into chaos; when moses extends his potent rod over the sea – which obeys like a loyal server – the waves bounce back to overwhelm the enemy war, leaving the chosen race safe to roll toward canaan from the shore, hustlin’ through a wild desart that ain’t the easiest path (lest a canaanite alarm yeets a rookie war so hard they get scared and yeet back to egypt for a lame servitude life), proving that even when you’re untrained in arms life’s still sweeter free as heck, which they score by their extended wilderness delay as they set up a chill government and choose a dope senate from the twelve tribes to rule by ordained, ancient laws

next up god from mount sinai – that gray peak shivering like a hacked screen – slides down with thunder, lightning, and booming trumpets, dropping divine laws that split into civil justice drip and sacrificial religious vibes hinting at that destined seed who’s gonna straight-up bruise the serpent with no cap, unlocking mankind’s deliverance; but yo god’s voice on mortal frequencies is pure terror, so they beg moses to drop his divine will and shut down the terror stream, and he lays it down that there’s no plug-in to god without the ultimate mediator (moses reppin’ that high-key avatar until someone even greater drops, whose day will be foretold by all the prophets singing for the great messiah), so with laws and rites locked in tight god’s over the moon when his squad vibes obediently and he blesses them by setting up his own tabernacle – his holy crib where he chills with mortal homies; by his orders they build a cedar sanctuary overlaid in gold, housing an ark with his testimony and covenant receipts topped with a gold mercy-seat wedged between two lit cherub wings, and seven lamps burn like a zodiac fire squad while a cloud hovers over the tent by day with a fiery gleam by night – except when they jet out on the road, then his angel guides them straight to the land promised to abraham and his fam, and the rest of the tea spills on epic battles, kings wrecked, kingdoms snatched, and even a day where the sun just stands still midheaven like a full-on freeze so that man can holler, “yo sun, stand in gibeon and moon in aialon, hold up till israel wins!” – that’s the third drop from abraham, son of isaac, whose whole fam is destined to snag canaan like the ultimate win

then here comes adam sliding in like an intermission, all like “o sent from heaven, enlightener of my darkest server crashes, drop those gracious deets” – mainly on abraham and his squad; now my eyes are wide like a fresh notification and my heart’s chillin’ hardcore, cuz i used to be lost in meltdown loops about my fate and that of all mankind, but now i see his day where every nation gets blessed and unearned favours dropped on me who once chased forbidden knowledge via shady hacks; still i can’t decode why god drops so many wild laws on his chosen earth crew – so many rules that spark endless sin drama, making even god scratch his head and wonder how he can hang with all this chaos – and michael chimes in that sin’s gonna reign among them like a viral clone, so law was served to expose their natural dumpster pravity by stirring up sin vs law brawls until they see that while law can spot sin, it can’t yeet it out without those weak, shadowy expiations (think bull and goat blood sacrifices) meaning extra pricey spill must be paid for man, balancing the unjust with righteous credit so that through faith they score justification with god and sweet peace of conscience that no ritual can fix, since man can’t even perform the mortal part – if you don’t perform, you basically don’t live; hence law’s just imperfect, set up to bench them until a better covenant drops, shifting from shadowy types to straight-up truth, from messy flesh to fierce spirit, from strict rulework to wide-open grace vibes, from servile fear to genuine homie bonds, flipping from works of law to works of faith

and so moses – even as god’s ride-or-die minister of law – ain’t the main dude to lead his peeps into canaan; nah fam, it’s joshua (the gentiles call him jesus, reppin’ a boss name and office) who’s gonna yeet that adversary-serpent and drag humanity back from the endless wilderness to chill safe in eternal paradise, no cap; meanwhile in earthly canaan the squad settles and vibes for a hot minute, prospering until national sins start trippin’ their public peace, provoking god to raise up some deadly enemies, and then, time and time again he saves them on the real – first with judges then under kings – where the second ruler, famed for pious rep and beastly deeds, gets an irrevocable promise that his regal throne is set to remain lit forever, and prophecies drop that from david’s royal fam (yeah, that king i name) will rise a son, foretold as the woman’s seed, pre-announced to abraham so that all nations can trust him, and destined to be the last king ever cuz his reign is eternal, big yikes if you disagree

but first a long-ass succession hustle goes down; his next son, celebrated for wealth and wisdom, forms the clouded ark of god that was roaming in tents until now getting enshrined in a glorious temple drop, and following him comes a mixed squad – part good, part bad (with the bad scroll running extra long) – whose off idolatries and other faults stack up to a popular sum that incenses god so hard he yeets them, exposing their land, city, temple, and holy ark along with all that sacred drip, serving as a savage reminder to that proud city with high walls left in total chaotic meltdown – thus babylon got its name; there in captivity they get locked up for seventy years until god, remembering his mercy and the covenant he swore to david way back when, brings them back, returned from babylon on a king-approved leave, and they first rebuild the house of god, living modestly for a bit until their wealth and numbers blow up and drama splinters the crew; and then among the priest hood, dissension sparks – dudes meant to vibe peacefully at the altar start stirring up mega strife, polluting the temple itself, and eventually they snatch the scepter while ignoring david’s sons, only to lose it to some random stranger, blocking the true anointed king messiah from being born with his rightful drip; yet at his birth a wild star, never seen before in heaven, blasts out to proclaim his arrival and guide eastern sages to scoop him up with incense, myrrh, and gold – his birthplace revealed by a solemn angel to humble shepherds on night watch who rush there ASAP and jam to his angelic carol beats; his mom stays a virgin, but his dad is the raw power of the most high, setting him up to ascend the hereditary throne and lock his eternal reign across earth’s wide bounds while his glory collides with the heavens; he even ceased, peeping adam with overflowing joy that dripped like tears in a no-words moment, pure emotion without even a vent

yo prophet of epic glad news and finisher of utmost hope, now i totally get what my deepest vibes had been searching for in vain – why our great expectation is dubbed the seed of woman; virgin mother, hail up in that heavenly love, and yet from my own loins you’re gonna pop forth and from your womb drop the son of god most high, uniting god and man in the dopest fusion ever; now the serpent’s gotta bruise his capital hard with mortal pain – spill where and when their epic showdown goes down and which savage move will yeet the victor’s heel, and to michael i say: don’t even trip, cuz sin’s gonna reign among them just like your own cloned glitch, deadass for real, no cap!

yo, like deadass duel mode or them local wound vibes, straight up messin’ with your noggin or your kicks, no cap  
of head or heel: so check it, the son ain’t sharin’ that clout—manhood don’t just yeet into godhood, bruh  
yo, your manly drip ain’t gettin’ a glow-up into supreme divine flex, it’s more like a mega yeet against your enemy’s weak sauce, fr fr  
but nah, that enemy ain’t gettin’ clapped that easy, caught in 4k sus energy af  
yo satan, the ultimate troll who got yeeted from heaven and took a gnarly bruise like an epic oof, straight up deadass  
he’s totally disabled, not droppin’ that final fatal hit on ya, no cap big yikes  
then here comes your saviour, the ultimate gigachad rollin’ up to patch that death wound with savage drip, on god  
but check it, he ain’t about straight-up beef by yeeting satan himself, he’s out here wreckin’ satan’s shady hustle, his clout-turnin’ works and all your squad’s seed vibes, deadass  
naww, none of that lit magic happens unless u complete that missing hype u lowkey craved, obeyin’ god’s rulebook, no cap  
‘cause if u don’t follow the law, penalty death snatches you like a brutal ban—suffering death mode activated, major cringe  
that penalty’s the sick karma tax on your sin receipts and those spawned outta your own wild will, fr fr  
and only then can high-key justice chill, fully appaid with that boss energy  

yo, god’s rule he’s gonna execute to the max, droppin’ obedience and love like dual cheat codes—even tho love solo can flex the whole law game  
your punishment gets served IRL when he yeets into human mode, livin’ that reproachful life and cursed death drama, so salty  
spittin’ life vibes to every homie who vibes with his redemption hustle, showin’ that his obedient flex be racked over to their faith, savin’ ‘em with his epic merits while their own legal moves stay mid  

for real, this dude gon’ live hated and get blasted with straight-up blasphemy, snatched by force, judged, and condemned to a harsh death,  
a shameful, cursed mess nailed to the cross by his own crew, straight-up slain for droppin’ that new life juice, no cap  
but on that cross, he also yeets your haters—yeeting the whole anti-you law and all mankind’s sin drip—with him gettin’ crucified so those who truly trust his savage satisfaction never catch more of that negative clout, deadass  
so he dies, then boom, he bounces back quick—death ain’t got no power to stick around, no cap  
before the third epic light drop hits, the morning stars will peep him risin’ outta his grave, fresh like that early glow, legit aesthetic  
your ransom’s totally paid—man gets redeemed from the death trap, his own death tradin’ life to every soul who banks on the real drip, no lie  
yo, don’t sleep on this—embrace the mad benefit by that faith hustle not ghosted by lazy works, straight up  
this god-like flex cancels your doomed death, that sin-spawned fatal outcome you were due, forever losin’ life vibes, big yikes  
this epic act smashes satan’s dome, crushin’ his weak sauce strength, straight-up droppin’ the mic on sin and death, his two main sus flex arms, deadass  
and it nails even harder in his skull than any temporary death can bruise the victor’s heel or those he redeems—death becomes like a chill sleep, a gentle drift into that immortal life nap, on god  

after that epic resurrection, he won’t be chillin’ on earth forever—just droppin’ by now and then for his die-hard disciples who ride his wave nonstop, no cap  
he leaves them in charge to spill all the tea to every nation ‘bout his lit saga and ultimate salvation vibes  
those who vibe hard enough get baptized in that plenteous stream—a sign of scrubbing away sin guilt for pure life, prepped in mind if death, like his own epic exit, comes knockin’ again, fr fr  

all nations catch the vibe; from that day, salvation isn’t just served to abraham’s own squad, but to every homie of abraham’s faith worldwide—so in his seed, every nation gets blest, such unreal drip  

then boom, he ascends to the heavens with full victory flex, triumphin’ through the air over all his foes and your haters; he catches that serpent, the prince of air, straight up draggin’ him into chains from across his whole shady realm, leavin’ it all confuzzled, bruh  
then he slides into glory mode, reclaimin’ his gigachad seat at god’s right hand, exalted above every name in heaven, extra AF  
and from that epic post, when this world’s breakup is on point, he rolls in with mega glory and power to judge both the living and the ghosted dead, no cap  
he’s gonna judge the unfaithful dead while droppin’ mad rewards to his loyal fam, receivin’ them into pure bliss whether they’re in the heavenly club or on earth, legit  
‘cause then the earth transforms into a straight-up paradise, a way happier zone than that cringey edey vibe, on god  

so spake arch-angel michael—droppin’ that savage decree and then pausing mid-meme—and our big boss sire, overflowin’ with joy and wonder, clappin’ back like, “yo listen up, squad”  
o infinite goodness, o immense goodness! all this dope good springin’ from evil, turnin’ that evil back to lit good vibes, even more wonder-full than that OG creation flex that yeeted light straight outta darkness, no lie  
i’m straight up shook with doubt, wonderin’ if i should repent for my sin shenanigans or just hype it up ‘cause mad good vibes gonna spring from it, so many extra gains for god’s glory and more goodwill to men—overflowin’ grace over wrath on major flex  

but yo, if our deliverer jets back up to heaven, what’s gonna go down for his loyal few left chillin’ among the unfaithful herd, the real enemies of truth?  
who’s gonna guide his squad, the peeps who defend the vibe? are they gonna get even roasted by the haters like they did him? that’s a major sus, big yikes  
be sure they will, the angel deadass says, but from up in heaven he’s droppin’ a comforter for his own crew, the father’s promise, who’s gonna chill his spirit inside 'em like extra DLC, fr fr  
and the law of faith, powered by that genuine love, will scribble itself on their hearts, guidin’ ’em through all the raw truth; plus, they’ll be kitted out with dope spiritual armor, ready to shut down satan’s lame darts and fiery memes, no cap  
nobody can screw with them, even if it comes down to a deathrun, ‘cause they be fearless titans, straight-up  
they face all that savage cruelty with mad inner consolations and support that’ll leave their haters shook, rofl  
‘cause the spirit got poured on his apostles first—those OG messengers sent to evangelize every nation—and then on all baptized peeps, blessin’ them with rad gifts to spit every language and pull off miracles like their lord did before, epic AF  
thus they win mad numbers from every nation, receivin’ the heavenly tea with joy, full-on lit mood  
finally, once their ministry is done and the race is run, their doctrine and epic story get writ down, then they dip; but in their old crib, just as they warned, nasty wolves roll in as teachers—grim and grievous ones who flip all the sacred mysteries of heaven to serve their shady profit and ambition, all for lucre, no cap  
and the truth gets tainted by bogus superstitions and lame traditions, left only in those old scrolls that only the spirit-level peeps can decode, fr fr  

next, these clout chasers gonna snatch up names, places, and fancy titles to link with that secular power—feigning to be all spiritual while lowkey appropriating god’s own spirit, the same one dished out to every believer  
and from that bogus act, they force carnal might disguised as spiritual laws onto everyone’s conscience, like shady rule spam  
laws that nobody can find written in any roll or that the inner spirit doodles on your heart like a random meme, deadass  
so what? they force the spirit of grace itself, binding its ride-or-die liberty, straight-up wrecking the living temples built on pure faith that were meant to stand on their own, no cap  
‘cause on earth, who dares diss faith and conscience without gettin’ roasted as infallible? yet many will presume, and then heavy persecution’ll come down on all who stick to worshipping spirit and truth hard, while most fools settle for outward rituals and phony poses that leave truth retired and slandered, with scarce works of faith left, major cringe  
so the world rolls on, with good malignant peeps and bad benign dudes, all groaning under their own weight, until that day comes  
when respiration beams on the just and sweet vengeance slaps the wicked, at the return of the one recently promised to aid you—the woman’s seed, that once-obscure prophecy now amplified, your saviour and lord, so lit  
finally, up in the clouds and revealed straight from heaven in the father’s glory, he’s gonna dissolve satan and his twisted world; then, rising from the blazing chaos all purified, he drops new heavens and a new earth, eternal ages founded on righteousness, peace, and love  
bringing forth ultimate fruits, mad joy, and eternal bliss, fr fr  

he ended; and then adam dropped the final mic reply  
yo, how quick your prophecy, blessed seer, mapped out this fleeting world and its time race until time itself got frozen—beyond that is just a wild abyss called eternity, unreachable by any peeper, deadass  
i’m rolling out, super loaded with wisdom, peace of mind on point, fillin’ my brain with all the knowledge this crammed vessel can hold—beyond that, my foolish ambitions were just extra, big yikes  
so from now on, i learn that obeying is the move and lovin’ the only god with a dash of fear is the only way; you gotta walk like you’re always in his presence, peep his providence, and depend solely on him—he’s all that mercy over his dope works, with good always out here flexin’ over evil, achievin’ huge things with what’s seen as weak moves  
flippin’ the worldly strong and worldly wise with pure meek vibes: sufferin’ for truth’s sake is the ultimate fortitude leading to highest victory, no cap  
and for the real faithful, death is just the next-level gate to life, fr fr  
taught by his own epic example, i now madly acknowledge him as my ever-blessed redeemer  
and to him the angel also dropped the last savage reply, straight up preachin’ that truth, fam  

this being learned, you’ve basically racked up the total sum of wisdom; don’t expect somethin’ higher, even if you knew all the stars by name and every single ethereal power, all deep secrets of the universe, every nature flex in heaven, air, earth, or sea, and even all the world’s riches and one empire’s rule; just add your epic deeds to your answerable knowledge—add faith, add virtue, patience, temperance; add love, soon to be dubbed charity, the soul of it all; then you won’t be buggin’ about ditchin’ this paradise, ‘cause you’ll be rockin’ a paradise within you, way happier, real talk  

alright, let’s yeet down from this high-top speculation summit ‘cause the clock’s tickin’ for our partin’, and peep the guards camped on that hill – they’re waitin’ to roll, fronted by a flaming sword wildin’ in savage removal vibes, furious AF  
we can’t stick around no more: go wake up eve; i even calmed her with gentle dream vibes, portending all that good, gettin’ her spirit squad set for chill submission  
yo, when the time’s right, have her roll with you and soak up all you just peeped, especially the deets that hit her faith hard—that great deliverance comin’ through her own seed on all mankind (for real, by the woman’s seed, major plot twist)  
so that y’all can live many days in one epic, unanimous faith—even if it’s kinda sad ‘cause of past evils—but then get even more hyped meditatin’ on that happy, ultimate end  

he wrapped it up, and they both dipped down the hill; adam slid to the chill bower where eve was nappin’—ran ahead but found her already awake—and she greeted him with vibes not sad, all upbeat and real, no cap  

i know exactly where you bounced from and where you dipped to, ‘cause god himself even catches z’s and dropps cosmic dream advice, legit tea.

yo, he lobbed that wicked cosmic drip, some mega good sauce, no cap, deadass  
foretelling all that heavy sad feels cuz i was drowning in lowkey heartache vibes, fr  
i crashed hard, zonked out like a noob, but now yo, guide me—let’s yeet it up, fam  

i ain't draggin, so i'm strapped to bounce with u, pronto, on god fr  
but if u dip, i’m stuck here, lowkey sus, so u gotta ride or die with me—no cap,  
‘cause u 2 me are the whole damn universe, every lit spot on this vibe map, deadass  
even tho u got benched from heaven for my wild flex crime, like full ban-mode, lol  

yo check it, i still lug this extra solace drip even tho my whole vibe is toast,  
this prime fav flex u dished out, i ain’t even worthy, but my promised seed is set 2 retcon all the mess, big yikes  

so our mama eve dropped that wisdom bomb, and adam was all like “omg, sick vibe,”  
but kept it on the down-low, ‘cause then the arch-angel popped off so close,  
and from the flip-side hill, the cherub squad rolled in full drip parade,  
gliding on the ground like meteoric skrrt, like that evening mist from some marshy river,  
gathering squad real quick at the laborer’s kicks, then headin’ home, pure yeet  

front and center, god flexed his savage sword, blazing like a wild comet,  
spitting torrid heat and mad steam like libyan burn air, roastin’ that chill zone hard,  
then the speedster angel snatched our loitering parents in each hand,  
yeeting ‘em straight to the eastern gate and down the cliff at warp speed to that subjugated plain—then poof, ghosted  

glancing back, they peeped the entire eastern slice of paradise,  
their old happy crib lit up and looking smoked by that flaming sword,  
the gate swarmed with spooky, dreadful faces and fiery, flexin’ arms—  
they even dropped some real tear drops but wiped ‘em off in a hot sec, sksksk  
the whole world lay before them, like a giant pick-your-spot rest game with providence as their ultimate gps,  
so hand in hand, wanderin’ slow-mo, they rolled through eden on their lone quest, deadass

1.c. the project gutenberg literary archive foundation (aka the foundation or pglaf) holds the big copyright hookup on the whole project gutenberg™ e-squad  
almost all these gems are public domain in the us, no cap  
if a work ain’t locked by copyright in the us and u’re chillin’ stateside, we ain’t tryna stop u from copyin’, spamming, performin’, showin’, or remixin’ it—as long as u ghost all direct project gutenberg mentions  
obvi, we hope u ride with the project gutenberg™ mission of free e-access by sharin’ these works free and loud, as long as the project gutenberg™ tag stays glued on

if u’re outside the us, peep ur local rules along with these vibes before you download, copy, show off, perform, or remix any project gutenberg™ work  
the foundation ain’t droppin’ any guarantees on copyright status outside the us, fr

1.e. unless u ghost all the project gutenberg tags:

 1.e.1. u gotta plaster this sentence—with clickable boss links or instant access to the full project gutenberg™ license—loud and clear whenever any copy of a project gutenberg™ piece (any jam reppin’ "project gutenberg") is accessed, shown, performed, peeped, copied, or spammed around:

1.e.2. yo fam if ur project gutenberg™ electronic drop is straight up lifted from texts that ain't got that u.s. copyright flex cuz there’s no lit notice sayin its posted with permission of the copyright hype beast deadass then u can copy and blast it to anyone in the united states no fees, no cap, like straight up free fuel for all npcs lol if u be redistributing or droppin that work with the “project gutenberg” tag, u gotta vibe with the rules from 1.e.1 thru 1.e.7 or snag proper permission for using the work and that project gutenberg™ trademark drip as stated in 1.e.8 or 1.e.9, on god fr fr

1.e.3. yo so if ur project gutenberg™ creation is posted with the blessing of the copyright big boss, u must lock in both the standard rulebook 1.e.1 all the way to 1.e.7 AND any extra fire terms the copyright lord drops – those extra deets are linked like your fave meme tag to the project gutenberg™ license at the front of this entire saga, deadass straight up

1.e.4. listen up, no cap: don’t ever unlink, detach, or yeet the full project gutenberg™ license terms from this work or any files holdin any piece of this epic drop or any other project gutenberg™ content – keep that license vibe glued like a sticker on your rig, period

1.e.5. bruh, dont be tryna copy, flex, perform, or reshare any part of this electronic masterpiece without slammin’ that lit sentence from 1.e.1 with active links or instant access to the full project gutenberg™ license deets – gotta show off that rule like a badge of honor, caught in 4k style, deadass

1.e.6. so like, u can totally flip, convert, or distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary, or proprietary form – word docs, hypertext, all that jazz, but if u provide access to or share copies in a format that ain’t the official “plain vanilla ascii” or the version posted on the legit project gutenberg™ website (www.gutenberg.org) then u MUST, with zero extra cost, fee, or any cringe expense for the user, drop a copy or an export hookup for the original “plain vanilla ascii” or whatever the OG format is – plus every alternate format gotta rock the full project gutenberg™ license plug as stated in 1.e.1, on god fr fr, no exceptions

1.e.7. heads up, u better not charge any mad coin for access, viewing, flexin, performing, copying, or distributing any project gutenberg™ works unless u’re locked in with the rules in 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 – fee hustle only if u play by the book, trust

1.e.8. aight so u can charge a reasonable fee for droppin copies or providin access to or dishing out project gutenberg™ electronic bops provided that:  
   • yo, u gotta drop a royalty fee of 20% of the gross bag u make from these gutenberg™ drops, calculated using the same grind u use for your tax sums – this fee goes straight to the owner of the project gutenberg™ trademark but guess what, he’s already down to donate these royalties to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation so royalty cash must be paid within 60 days after each tax return sesh, and these payments should be mad clearly marked as royalty cash and sent to the address in section 4, “information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation,” like a proper bank transfer, no cap  
   • if a user slides into u with a written note or email within 30 days sayin they ain’t vibin with the full project gutenberg™ license terms, u gotta hit them with a full refund – and u must make that user return or straight up destroy all physical copies they locked down and stop any further use or access to any other project gutenberg™ works, straight up cancel the cringe  
   • in line with 1.f.3, if a defect in the electronic work shows up and gets reported within 90 days of receiving the work, u gotta serve a full refund for that piece or hook them with a replacement copy – no ifs, ands, or buts, deadass  
   • and lastly, obey all the other terms of this free distribution agreement for project gutenberg™ works – stick to the whole vibe or get caught in a mega glitch, on god, fr fr, skibidi bye bye n00b vibes

1.e.9. yo if ur tryna flex a fee or yeet a project gutenberg™ digital drop or bundle of works on terms not in this lit af agreement deadass u gotta slide a written pp to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation – the big boss of that trademark, no cap hit up the foundation as lowkey spelled out in section 3 below

1.f.1. so check it fam project gutenberg volunteers and staff go ham huntin’ down deets, diggin’ into copyright tea, transcribin’ and proofreadin’ works that ain’t locked by u.s. law while buildin’ the project gutenberg™ collection deadass even tho they hustle mad u might still peep glitches like incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription oopsies, copyright or intel property drama, busted disk or medium, computer virus mayhem, or codes wreckin’ your gear – big yikes, fr fr

1.f.5. yo some states be like nah to disclaimin’ those implied warranty vibes or excludin’ certain damage types if any disclaimer or limit in this agreement is sus and breaks state law then the agreement gets reworked to max out the disclaimer vibes allowed by that state law legit and if a part goes mega invalid it don’t wreck the rest of the squad’s rules, deadass
