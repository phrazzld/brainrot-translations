yap, my muse, spin that chaotic vibe of book 3—
when aeneas and the troy day-ones dip from their ashy hometown,
coz the gods said “lol trojan city meltdown complete, time to scram.”
so we outfit the fleet at the foot of mt. ida, uncertain asf,
and father anchises is like, “we go where fate leads.”
i leave behind troia’s ruins, tears streaming, penates in tow,
feelin’ exiled frfr, cast onto the waves with my brood.

first we post up in thrace, land once friendly—haha sike, not now.
i hack at a bush to decorate altars, and black gore drips out.
i’m big shook. polydorus, a trojan prince ghost, moans:
“don’t violate my grave, bro, i’m stuck under these skewers,
done dirty for gold by a shady thracian king.”
holy L, we dip from that cursed place fast—like, no thanks.
we bury polydorus properly, big funeral vibes, then hoist sails again.

next up, apollo’s holy island, delos. we vibe with king anius,
beg the golden archer for a stable home. the shrine convulses,
and the deity roars: “seek your *og motherland*, that’s your vibe.”
anchises interprets: “creta’s the spot,” so we zoom that way.
we try building “new troy” there, but a nasty plague bricks us:
crops wither, folks fold, we get the major sads.
penates appear in my dream, like “bruh, your real roots are in *italy*,
not crete—pack up, keep searching.” *facepalm* but we bounce.

we sail off again, land on the strophades, where the harpies dwell—
these vile bird-ladies plop stank droppings all over our feasts,
ruin the vibe with their screeching. one named celaeno curses us:
“you’ll make it to italy, but you’ll be so starved, you’ll *eat your tables.*”
uh, big yikes. we break out, keep it movin’,
hit leucate next, rock some mini trojan olympics (shockingly hype).
then we coast to epirus, find a mini “troy 2.0,” built by helenus,
who’s shockingly married to andromache (once hector’s queen).
it’s awkward, also kinda sweet: they run a trojan cosplay city,
complete with a mini xanthus. andromache sees us, ugly-cries,
remembering old days, her beloved hector, all the heartbreak.
helenus, part-time prophet, warns: “avoid scylla and charybdis.
pray *hard* to juno, or she’ll ruin your day. watch for that sign
of the white sow with 30 piglets—there your city stands.
and when you meet the sibyl in cumae, show respect.”
then he loads us with gear, horses, and a hearty “go forth, king.”

we push on, navigating around the cyclops zone.
(once we pick up achaemenides, a leftover from odysseus’s crew,
who’s borderline feral from dodging polyphemus’s next meal.)
we see polyphemus wade into the surf, eye-socket an epic crater,
sheep trailing him. dude roars so loud the sea trembles.
we ghost out, row like maniacs, slip the clutch of giant terrors.

finally, we land in drepanum on sicily. tragedy hits:
my father anchises, mvp of my heart, passes away.
i’m lost in sorrow. no prophecy gave me the heads-up, no cheat code,
just a savage goodbye. that’s where i close out the tale,
with me drifting next toward carthage, fate still in flux,
carrying the heavy memory of anchises and a million miles to go.
