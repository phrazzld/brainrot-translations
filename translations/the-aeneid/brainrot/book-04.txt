yap, muse, about how queen dido was big done in by that savage love-lorn meltdown,
burning in her bloodstream with this hush-hush flame, no chill in sight.
over and over she replays aeneas’s vibes—his brood, his war stories—
and she can’t catch a wink, she’s that pressed. next morning, all bleary-eyed,
she rants to sis anna:

“anna bestie, i’m going insane fr. this trojan guy just rolled in so OP—
the flex in his face, the feats he’s done? i can’t. i said i’d never date again,
not after sychaeus ghosted me via *murder*, but i’m so down bad i can’t even.”

anna’s like, “girl, yolo. no sense in being single 4ever. plus, your city’s shaky,
numidians next door got zero chill. why not lock in with a trojan main?
the gods are prob shipping you two, so do the sacrifice hustle and vibe.”

boom, dido’s hype skyrockets. they spam offerings at all the altars:
cows, incense, you name it, especially for juno (marriage goddess, wink wink).
but real talk, she’s all meltdown city, trailing aeneas around carthage,
pointing out fancy stuff, then mid-sentence drifting into daydream.
she calls for nightly feasts to hear him retell troy’s war drama.
meanwhile, the new city’s construction? oof, put on hold—nobody’s doing squat;
the walls half-built, scaffolding vibes just left hanging.

over in olympus, juno sees she can exploit dido’s mega-crush,
so she slides up to venus: “congrats on your trojan hooking dido,
but let’s keep it 100—why not a real alliance? i’ll stage a *marriage*,
they’ll co-rule carthage. that’s good, right?”
venus, side-eyeing but seeing no downside, goes, “eh sure, if jupiter’s cool. do your thing.”

cue big hunting expedition next morning. dido busts out in royal gold drip,
aeneas shining apollo-core. ascanius is goofing, hoping for a wild boar cameo.
then juno conjures a savage storm—hail, thunder, the works—everyone scatters,
except dido and aeneas end up in the same cave. mother earth and juno
seal the deal: boom, they smash. dido calls it marriage to soothe the guilt,
like “he’s all mine now, no shame.”

rumor, that messy goddess, hears all this tea. she blasts the drama across africa:
“did y’all see dido hooking up with trojan bae? ignoring her city? scandal!”
king iarbas, who got friend-zoned by dido, is *pressed*.
he whines to jupiter: “bruh, i gave her land, she ghosted me,
and now she’s posted up with this trojan? do something!”
jupiter’s like, “okay, enough.” so he dispatches mercury:
“aeneas, my guy, you’re slacking on your big destiny. italy’s calling, go now.”

mercury zips down, finds aeneas rocking dido’s fancy cloak,
playing sim-husband building her city. mercury’s all, “dude, wtf,
your kid ascanius has a literal empire to found. chop-chop.” then dips.
aeneas is shook, hair standing up, speechless.
he orders the trojans: “pack the ships on the low—time to bounce.”

dido? she senses something’s off (love sees all).
when she learns he’s ghosting, she flips out: “did i not give you everything??
and you skip out like i’m a fling? i saved you, i rejected local suitors—this is how you repay me??”
aeneas, choking back tears, must obey the gods: “i never said it was official-official.
i have to do what fate demands. it kills me, but i gotta.”

enraged, she curses him: “hope you crash on some jagged rocks,
i’ll haunt you, sucker.” she storms away. trojans hustle to load ships,
like frantic ants storing grain. from her tower, dido sees them swarming the harbor,
her heartbreak is real. she begs anna to beg aeneas for a short delay.
no dice—fate outranks heartbreak.

now dido sees ominous signs: black blood in the temple bowls,
ghostly wails at night. she’s done. she sets up a big funeral pyre,
pretends it’s for purifying the trojan’s leftover stuff. anna’s clueless.

midnight: dido rants alone, can’t sleep. next dawn, seeing his sails vanish,
she curses him to cosmic enmity between their peoples—
that’s the birth of the punic wars, lowkey. then climbs the pyre,
pulls out aeneas’s sword, stabs herself. anna hears the screams, rushes in:
“sis, wtf, you didn’t let me share your fate?” tries to cradle dido.
dido bleeds out, eyes rolling, world fading. juno pities her slow death,
sends iris to snip the last thread of life from her hair, freeing her soul.
thus ends the tragic meltdown of queen dido.
