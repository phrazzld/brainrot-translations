sic our boi aeneas sobs and rolls up on his fleet all moody,
slapping the sea with sails unfurled till they crash at cumae’s shores,
no cap, the anchors cling to the bay’s curvy edges
and the trojan squad jumps ship, each man hype asf
to scavenge for that flint-spark flame or track down beastly hideouts,
while aeneas—giga-chad of piety—dips to the hills
where big apollo’s vibes stand guard,
plus that sibyl’s mad spooky cave.
delian apollo straight beams her brain with prophecy,
revealing tings that’d have you shook.

they pass the hoods sacred to trivia; they peep daedalus’s big flex:
bro flew from minos’s drama on powered wings, gliding north
past icy stars, till he perched on cumae’s peak
and dedicated his magical feathers to phoebus,
then built epic temples decked out with cringe-fests of crete:
androgeos’s death, athenians paying annual kid-tribute,
the monstrous bull-lust of pasiphae, the labyrinth so savage.
daedalus, pitying the queen’s twisted thirst,
helped theseus not get caught lacking: homie gave him that thread,
like “ayo, spool = survival,” ‘cause minotaur go brr.
icarus would’ve been part of this masterpiece, if tears didn’t hold daedalus back.
aeneas is *this close* to vibin’ in all the carved lore,
but achates shows up with sibyl in tow,
priestess of phoebus and trivia, who’s like: “bffr, we got no time for sightseeing.”
“yo, we need seven unyoked bulls, seven squeaky-clean sheep, let’s cook,”
so they do the sacrifice hustle, trailing behind the seer.

the sibyl’s crib: a monstrous cave slashed in euboic rock,
a hundred throats spitting a hundred savage echoes.
we approach, she says: “time to demand the fates, bruh. we got the *god incoming*,”
and all of a sudden her face is new, color flipping, hair undone,
her breath ragged, chest savage with the rage of the divine,
like apollo possessed her big time.
“why you slacking on prayers, trojan aeneas? bde or bust. pray up now,
or these hundred mouths ain’t spitting squat.”
she goes quiet. the trojans tremble (shook to the bone).
king aeneas prays deep from his chest:
“phoebus, you who pity trojan struggles, who guided paris’s arrow
into achilles’s heel, who led me ‘cross savage seas and scorching dunes,
let me snag a chunk of italy’s shores once and for all.
i ain’t asking for freebies—just let trojan fates bloom in latium,
where i can post up my battered gods.
in thanks i’ll build a marble temple for you and trivia,
host major feast-days in your name, and i’ll make sure, prophetess,
your words get cherished permanent. just don’t scribble on leaves
and let them get yeeted by the wind. spit them real, bestie.”
end of speech.

but the seer still wrestles the big apollo in her chest,
spewing prophecy mania: the more she tries to chill,
the harder he cooks her from inside, taming that fierce heart.
till the cave doors fling open themselves, and that hundredfold echo booms:
“you made it big off sea miseries, aeneas, but land is about to go savage.
chill not, ‘cause i see war, gnarly war, tiber frothing with blood.
don’t think you left behind your simois or xanthus or greeks;
some new achilles is cooking in latium, mom’s a goddess too.
juno stays pressed, so prepare to beg half of italy for help.
yeah, your downfall? a foreign bride all over again—
but don’t fold. hustle bigger.
your rescue lane opens from a greek city, plot twist of the century.”

the sibyl roars illusions from the deep, rolling cryptic bars,
apollo cracks the whip in her soul. once the fury chills,
aeneas shrugs: “girl, i’m used to bs. i’m trojan asf. i’ve seen it all.
just one request: rumor says hades’s gate is near,
i beg you, show me the route, let me see my dad again.
i saved him back in the war, carried him out of troy,
he sailed with me across every wave, defied old age plus savage storms,
but fate took him too soon. he told me to come here seeking you,
holy sibyl. i know orpheus once finessed his wife from the underworld,
pollux dips in and out for his bro, theseus and hercules pulled up.
my lineage is jove’s line—help a trojan out.”

holding altars, aeneas begs.
sibyl’s like: “anchises’s blood, child of the gods,
down is easy, up is a boss-level quest. only a few ever do it.
if you’re so desperate to YOLO the styx, you gotta do the side-quests:
there’s a golden bough hidden in shadowy woods, consecrated to the underworld’s queen.
only if you pluck it, fresh and legit, may you pass.
but first, you gotta bury a homey who died unawares,
his corpse pollutes your entire squad. you won’t cross the river
till you do him right—sacrifice black cattle and set him at rest.
then you can vibe with the underworld.”

aeneas leaves the cave, weighed down by gloom.
achates follows, same vibe, they wonder who’s dead.
on the beach they find misenus, hector’s ex-horn-blaster,
hyped to call gods to battle on his shell conch.
supposedly triton clapped him, hurling him in the surf, big oof.
the trojans wail, especially aeneas, then hustle to build the funeral pyre,
felling pines and oaks in the wild forest.
aeneas prays: “if only that golden bough would just show up rn,
so we can prove misenus was no random.”
and boom, twin doves (mom’s birds) swoop in, a sign from above.
aeneas goes “my guy apollo, or probably my mom venus, help me find it.”
the doves lead him into the stank mouth of avernus, settling on a shining oak.
gold glints among the leaves, shining out like dripped-out mistletoe in winter.
aeneas, thirsting, snatches that branch, which resists but yields to fate,
and heads back to sibyl’s lair, golden pass in hand.

meanwhile trojans weep on the shore, giving misenus his final salute:
the pyre is stacked, black cypress around it, arms shining on top.
some boil water to wash the corpse, anoint with oils, tears all around.
they lay him on the couch in purple cloth, light the wood from beneath,
burn offerings, toss in bowls of oil.
when the flames collapse, bones get scooped, purified with wine,
corynaeus encloses the ashes in a bronze urn,
sprinkles buds of olive and water round the homies,
and aeneas sets a massive tomb, placing misenus’s horn and oar.
the place forever named misenum.
then—time to obey the sibyl.

there’s a deep cave, monstrous mouth gaping wide,
reeking waters, shadowed by black forests,
noxious breath rising, no bird passes unscathed.
they set four black bulls, the sibyl pours wine on their foreheads,
plucks bristles from between their horns to toss in the holy flame,
calls out hecate, boss-lady of sky and underworld,
others slit throats, gather warm blood in bowls.
aeneas slices a black-fleece lamb for the furies’ mother,
another for prosperpina, then sets up altars for hades,
burning fatty chunks with oil.
at dawn the ground booms, hills shift, hounds bay in the murk—
the goddess is coming. sibyl yells “back off if you’re not pure,
get tf out, aeneas, draw your sword. we’re going in.”
she storms into the gloom, trojan king matching her steps.

“oh gods who rule souls, silent shades, chaos, and raging phlegethon,
let me speak truth of what i heard, may your vibe allow me.”
they creep in darkness, gloom on gloom, realms of disbodied ghosts,
like a weird forest trek in half-moon light, jupiter’s stormclouds overhead.
at the gates: sorrow, vengeance, pale diseases, old age, fear, hunger, poverty,
death, toil, sleep, twisted joys, war in the threshold,
and strung-out discord with viper hair.
center stage stands a shadowy elm, illusions nest there,
and all sorts of chimeric beasts roam: centaurs, scyllas, hydra, chimera spitting flames,
gorgons, harpies, triple-bodied shades.
aeneas tries to slash them, but the sibyl’s like “chill bruh, these are intangible npcs.”

they reach the black waters of acheron, swirling filthy silt,
charon the ferryman, terrifying in ragged gloom,
beard unkempt, eyes flaming, cloak knotted on his shoulder.
he rows the rust-red skiff, older than dirt but immortally strong.
masses of souls wait on the bank: mothers, heroes, kids, unwed girls,
like leaves in autumn or birds fleeing cold seas.
some he ferries, some he shoves back.
aeneas, mind-blown, asks sibyl: “why the difference, wise queen?”
she says: “anchisean blood, that’s the styx, oath of the gods.
unburied = can’t cross. they wander a hundred years.
once that’s up, they’re free to pass.”
he sees leucaspis, orontes, trojans drowned by storm.
palinurus emerges—dude fell off the ship by star-watching fail.
aeneas: “apollo lied, said you’d be safe, what happened?”
palinurus: “the rudder ripped off, i fell. i drifted for days,
finally glimpsed italy, but savage locals got me.
please bury me or let me cross.”
sibyl butts in: “bro, no. you can’t waltz across unburied.
but chill—locals will be spooked by omens, build you a tomb,
place offerings. forever you’ll be remembered.”
palinurus calms, consoled by the name that’ll last.

they approach charon. charon barks: “freeze. who’s rolling up alive in my domain?
hercules, theseus, pirithous tried to drag folks from hades. not again.”
sibyl says: “relax, we’re not heisting your queen. look at this golden bough,
the official vip pass.”
charon’s anger melts, he waves them on. souls get shoved out the boat,
aeneas steps in, the battered skiff groans under his mortal weight,
but they cross safely and land in the slime.
there stands cerberus, triple-throated, monstrous.
sibyl whips out a honey-laced treat spiked with sleepy juice,
cerberus devours it, knocks out full length.
aeneas swoops by.

first they hear the wailing of babes who died too soon,
then those wrongly executed, judged by minos,
then those who ended themselves, hating the sun—
all wishing they could push reset and face normal struggles.
the black swamp locks them in.
next, the fields of mourning, for folk devoured by cruel love.
phaedra, procris, eriphyle, pasiphae, laodamia, caeneus returned to female form.
dido roams in a big forest, fresh from that self-inflicted wound.
aeneas spots her, tries to talk. “was i the reason? i swear i dipped unwillingly.
the gods forced me to chase italy. don’t ghost me, bestie.”
but she’s stone cold, eyes fixed on the ground, silent like marble.
she dashes away to sychaeus, her real one, while aeneas weeps,
pitying her fade.

they move on, find the high-tier heroes of trojan wars:
tydeus, parthenopaeus, pale adrastus, trojans who died in battle.
the greeks freak out again, half turning tail like at the ships.
he sees deiphobus, torn face, ears gone, nose shredded.
aeneas is like, “dang, who did you dirty?”
deiphobus: “helen, that cursed spartan. set me up in my wedding bed.
she let menelaus in, i was half-asleep, swords took me out.
but enough about me, how you rolling in hades?”
they’d chat forever, but sibyl says: “night’s coming, we gotta bounce.
two paths: right to elysium, left is to punishing tartarus.”
deiphobus is like: “peace out, love.” and leaves.

aeneas looks left: triple-walled fortress, swirling with fire-rivers,
phlegethon blazing, a massive iron tower, tisiphone stands guard,
blood-soaked robe, sleepless eyes. shrieks, whips, clanking chains echo.
aeneas chills in fear: “wtf punishments are these?”
sibyl: “nobody pure can cross that threshold. i can only show.
rhadamanthus tears secrets from souls who thought they’d cheat fate.
tisiphone tortures them with snakes and whips.
hydra lurks inside with 50 black jaws.
tartarus drops deeper than olympus is high.
there lie titans thrown by jove’s thunder.
there sits salmoneus who tried to mimic jove’s lightning,
riding his chariot, brandishing torches, but got zapped for his insolence.
tityos sprawled over nine acres, a vulture forever munching his liver.
ixion, pirithous under a tipping boulder, feasts in sight but furies say ‘nope.’
anyone who wronged parents, defrauded clients, hoarded wealth, betrayed loyalty—
they’re stuck here. some roll boulders, some dangle on wheels.
phlegyas howls: ‘respect the gods, learn justice!’
this place is for those who sold out their city, fouled laws for gold, incest, or monstrous crimes.
my voice can’t list all sins. let’s not linger.”

after that cameo of cosmic karmic pains, sibyl’s like: “hurry. i see the cyclopes’ forges, the gates we’re aiming for. let’s deposit these tributes.”
they find a door carved from the living rock, place the golden bough upon it,
ritually purify, and at last they step into the pleasant meadows of the blessed.
sunlight glows in purple rays, they have their own star system,
some do gymnastics on green fields, some do dance circles singing,
others recite poetry, accompanied by thracian orpheus in a swirling robe.
there’s trojan ancestors, all shining, arms propped aside, horses grazing free.
aeneas gawks, sees more groups feasting under laurel groves by the mighty eridanus.
priests who stayed holy, bards who served phoebus well, artists, do-gooders—
all wearing snowy crowns.
sibyl calls to musaeus (the crowd’s center, a tall vibe),
“yo legend, we’re looking for anchises. can you show us the way?”
musaeus: “no fixed crib here, we roam shady groves. but go yonder ridge, you’ll see him.”
so they follow, find anchises chilling in a lush valley,
inspecting the souls of future mortals.
he sees aeneas, leaps with tears: “you came, son, piety won out.
let me hug you!” thrice aeneas tries, thrice the phantom slips away.
like wind or a dream.

aeneas spots the lethe stream, countless souls fluttering like bees.
he’s like “the vibe is weird, father, who are these?”
anchises: “souls destined for rebirth. they drink lethe’s forgetful water,
so they can go back to mortal realms. let me show you your glorious roman line.”
“why would they want back into mortal coil?” aeneas wonders.
anchises: “the world-soul spark animates all. but mortal bodies weigh us down,
we get sin buildup, need cleansing in underworld spa days.
some get purged by wind, water, or fire. after a thousand-year cycle,
they come here to reabsorb pure aether, then they choose new bodies.
now watch me drop the genealogical tea.”

he shows him silvius, next trojan-latin kings, father after father,
romulus founder of rome, wearing that helmet crest from mars.
rome: queen of the world, crowned with seven hills, mother of gods and men.
next, the big lineage: caesar, the julian clan,
augustus, golden age reloaded, stretching empire from garamantes to india.
the known world cowers in awe. more unstoppable than hercules or bacchus.
“so why you trojans still hesitant? y’all are *that* powerful.”
then old kings: numa, tullus, ancus, tarquins, brutus the avenger,
decian line, torquatus, camillus. see the two glimmering souls?
they’ll wage epic civil strife. father-in-law from the alps, son-in-law from the east—
anchises begs: “guys, calm your savage vibes, keep roman muscle for the real ops.”
marcellus looms, the unstoppable warrior who saved rome from gauls.
finally the young marcellus, overshadowed by gloom—
anchises tears up: “the fates only show us a glimpse. too lit for mortal life.
the campus martius will wail. oh, if we could keep him.
let me scatter purple blossoms, paying tribute in vain.”

they wander wide in those airy fields, enthralled,
and anchises fires up aeneas with visions of future wars,
what trials lie with latinus, how to hustle or be cautious in each scenario.
two gates of sleep: horn for real dreams, ivory for illusions.
anchises leads them out the ivory gate (the false one—some big cosmic pun),
aeneas returns to his ships, sails off to caieta’s harbor,
tosses anchor on the beach, trojans standing on the sand,
gearing up for new adventures.
