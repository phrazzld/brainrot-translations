yap at me, muse, about that next-level drama in book x,
when the gods had a board meeting in olympus but jupiter said “lol, i’m done picking sides,”
and yet aeneas still can’t catch a break in latium, no cap.

while our boy was linkin’ with the etruscans—new squads for the roster—
his fleet be sailing at night, guided by those nymph-boats (ex-ships, basically).
they tell him, “bro, back at camp, your trojans are big stressed, turnus going buckwild.”
so aeneas is like “say less,” does a speedrun across the waves,
pulls up on the scene at dawn, big swirl of swords on the shoreline.

the fight is an absolute meltdown:
pallas, evander’s wonderkid, absolutely vibin’, but oh my gods—
turnus sees him shining like a golden npc.
turnus stunts on pallas with a savage spear toss: big *rip* moment.
pallas hits the dirt, and the arcadians drop their jaws in heartbreak.

aeneas sees pallas down—man’s enters full psycho rage:
he’s out here deleting latins left and right,
like “y’all messed with my day-one’s son, time to pay up.”
blood’s on the grass, trojan steel glitters.
some think aeneas has that war god buff, the kill streak is insane.

juno tries a sneaky trick: she conjures a ghostly turnus,
baits aeneas onto a phantom-laden ship so the real turnus can bounce.
turnus is whisked away like “wtf just happened?”
he’s big salty, but can’t do squat—he’s ghosted from the main event.

meanwhile, aeneas storms the battlefield unstoppable,
fate’s glow up for trojan destiny shining out.
mezentius, that crusty tyrant, steps up, brandishing savage arrogance.
the dude slays some trojans, but aeneas corners him.
mezentius’s son lausus tries for a dad rescue, catches an l from aeneas’s blade,
and the father’s meltdown is real.
mezentius tries one last hail mary charge,
but aeneas’s spear lands lethal, dropping the tyrant in a swirl of dust.

so the day ends soaked in sorrow, a storm of souls parted from mortal coil.
pallas’s fresh cut looms heavy on aeneas’s heart,
and turnus loiters with guilt somewhere far away.
epic meltdown vibes, muse, that’s book x in the trojan-latin war,
where divine drama merges with mortal tears,
and destiny stands undefeated, fr fr.
