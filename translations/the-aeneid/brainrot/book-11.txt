darkness parted as aurora glided up the sky,
my boy aeneas, big sad but still on that champion vibe,
couldn’t skip his morning vows—he sets up a tree trunk, tall af,
trims the limbs, pins mezentius’s gear on it (dead flex, no cap),
“yo, mars,” he says, “peep these sweaty trophies, courtesy your boy.”
then he calls the trojan homies, ringed around him like stans,
all, “we done huge things—now bury our bros, level up next round,
these gear bits from that tyrant are just the starter pack.
hit latium’s walls soon—stay locked in, no glitching out when the gods say go.”

then he sighs, eyes leaking, heads to pallas’s sad couch,
where old man acoetes stands guard, trembling, ugh, heartbreak city.
trojans crowd around, women in mourning mode, hair unbound,
the place echoes with chest-thump sobs as aeneas enters.
he sees pallas, so fresh-faced, the italian spear wound still haunting his chest;
the hero’s tears pop out, voice shaky: “poor homie,
fate blocked you from seeing the scoreboard of our new realm,
or rolling up, victor, to your dad’s front gate.
i so promised dear evander i’d keep you safe...this is whack.
he’s probably burning offerings, clueless you’re gone.
dang, father, you’ll witness the funeral of your only glow.
this is the big w we bragged about? so cringe.
still, you’re not wearing shame on your chest, died a boss.
how big a guard we lost, italy, and you, iulus, oh man.”

he orders them to lift pallas’s body, and from that massive trojan lineup,
picks a thousand to escort the funeral—tiny comfort for a big heartbreak.
the men weave a soft bed of wicker, shady with green boughs,
lay the boy like a delicate flower freshly snipped—
still glows, but no energy, mother earth no longer feeds it.
aeneas breaks out dido’s fancy weaves, gold-stitched purple (top-tier merch),
drapes pallas’s hair, hides the soon-to-burn locks,
piles up laurentian spoils, gear from the dead, horses, arms,
chains up some captured latins for sacrifice, gloom stuff but it’s the way.
dukes lug enemy gear, tags with the baddies’ names,
acoetes stumbles, face in the dirt, punching himself.
pallas’s warhorse, aethon, follows, tears streaming from his muzzle.
after the funeral parade’s rolled out, aeneas halts with a sigh:
“farewell, pallas—forever. we got other tears to shed.”
he turns away, trudging off to the camps, heart heavy.

then, from latium’s city, a line of envoys wave olive branches,
begging for the bodies scattered on fields, so they can bury them in peace.
aeneas is chill, “i got no quarrel with corpses, dudes.
i’m here by fate’s command, not here to slaughter for fun.
your boy latinus ghosted my alliance, trusted turnus’s sword.
tell turnus: if he wants that big 1v1, i’m open.
but sure, gather your dead—i hold no grudge.”
the latins glance around silent, all “dang, this trojan’s pure vibes.”
drances, an og hater of turnus, tosses compliments:
“your clout so big, we can’t measure it, aeneas. we’ll push for peace,
maybe get you legit ties with our king, let turnus meltdown alone.”

the men set a truce of twelve days, trojans and latins commingle in the woods,
thwacking pines with axes, hauling cedar logs for pyres,
wagons groaning, the forest echoes with that funeral hustle.
word hits evander’s city: rumor switching from “pallas the victor!”
to “pallas is gone.” arcadians rush the gates with torches,
a long line of flames. trojans meet them, crying side by side,
the city mothers catch sight from rooftops, setting off wails.
evander breaks loose, flings himself on the corpse, hugging, sobbing:
“my boy, i told you: watch out for savage war. guess new glory was too sweet.
the gods ghosted my prayers. and you, my dear wife, lucky you dipped out early.
here i am, outliving my star, burying my child. if only i had died with him.
still, if turnus did this, i hope aeneas or pallas himself snuffs that man.
that’s all that’s left.”

dawn cracks again, folks gather their dead for pyres.
on the beach, aeneas, tarchon, lay the bodies in old tradition,
ignite them, black smoke climbs, men ride thrice around,
sprinkling tears and dust, chanting to the sky,
tossing spoils in the flames. at night, they keep vigil,
and latins likewise.

soon they gather bones in warm earth, then shuffle back, weeping.
in latinus’s city, it’s meltdown central: mothers, sisters, fatherless kids,
all cursing the war, the wedding that triggered it.
drances demands turnus surrender, but some defend him,
queen included, citing big kills and honor.
amid the chaos, ambassadors return from diomedes: big 404 not found,
no help, no gold can buy his sword. “the trojans are unstoppable,
maybe y’all should sign a peace.” latinus freaks out,
calls a big assembly, but it’s too late. now the trojan-etruscan cavalry swarms in.

everyone panics, the crowd screams for arms, turnus leaps up:
“okay, go talk peace if you want, but do it while these trojans torch your gates.
i’m out.” he storms off. father latinus sighs, regrets not hooking aeneas up.
some cityfolk scramble with logs, stakes, stones, the moms praying at minerva’s shrine,
hoping to break aeneas’s spear, the bride lavinia trailing, eyes lowered.
turnus suits up in bronze scales, gleaming with gold,
races from the palace like a horse busting free, mane tossing, savage.
camilla meets him with her volscian cavalry. she leaps off,
the squad imitates, and she’s all: “turnus, lemme handle that trojan horse front,
you guard the walls on foot.” turnus nods, big respect,
then sets an ambush in a wooded pass for aeneas.

meanwhile diana, from high seats of olympus, calls her girl opis:
“camilla’s riding to a tragic end, i once loved her—
her dad, exiled, raised her in the wild, promised her to me.
fate says she’s going down, so watch, and if some fool kills her,
punish him. then bring her weapons and body home for a decent memory.”
opis zips off.

the trojans, with etruscan cavalry, ring the plain in neat squads.
latins set in motion with messapus, coras, and camilla’s badass band.
they close range, fling spears like winter hail, the sky dims.
tyrrhenus slams into aconteus, who flies off his horse like a catapult shot,
shocking the latins into a brief retreat, trojans chase them to the gates,
then latins rally, trojans fallback, back and forth like waves.
finally both lines smash fully, men kill men, horses tumble, gore so thick.

camilla rampages like an amazon queen,
one side of her gear open, quiver bouncing, diana’s bow shining.
she flips spears, swings a big axe, even nails enemies while retreating.
her crew: larina, tulla, tarpeia with her bronze hatchet—
like that thracian swirl around penthesilea.
the kills stack up: eunaeus, lirim, pagasus, amastrus, tereus, harpalycus, demophoon, chromis—
countless trojans fall to the unstoppable queen.
she spots ornytus in his cringe lupi-helmet, nails him with a spear:
“did you think you’d be hunting forest beasts, tyrrhenian? guess not.
spread the word: you died to camilla.”
she gets butes in the back of the neck, orsilochus she outmaneuvers in a circle,
splits his skull, soaking the dirt in hot gore.
auni’s son tries trickery, challenges her to a foot duel then flees on horseback.
camilla’s like “nope,” outruns the horse, seizes the bridle, skewers him.
like a hawk snatching a fluttery pigeon, savage.

tarchon sees the trojans falter, big jove eggs him on,
he dives in, yanks venulus off his mount, drags him.
venulus flails like a snake in eagle talons, but tarchon holds on,
boosts the morale.

then arruns, stealth boy, shadows camilla, waiting for a cheap shot.
he sees her laser-focused on fancy chloreus, dripping in gold,
she hunts that gear like a cat eyeing stolen jewels.
arruns nails her with a single spear, begs apollo for success:
the god halfway grants it, letting him kill her but not letting him go home.
the spear hits her chest, deep under the exposed breast, she staggers,
her girls catch her as she tries to yank out the iron, vision blurs,
colors drain from her face. she calls her bestie acca:
“dang, sis, it’s a wrap for me. pass my final message to turnus—
he must keep them trojans out. goodbye.”
her soul flees with one last groan.

the latins freak the hell out, their fearless queen is down,
trojans surge, tyrrhenians join, arcadians flood in, unstoppable.
opis from up high sees camilla’s fate, sighs,
looses a golden arrow at arruns, kills him instantly, then bails.
the volsc cavalry scatters, rutuli too, no one can hold the trojan push.
they stampede for the walls, dust billowing, city mothers shriek from the ramparts.
some latins slam gates, locking out their own, men die in the moat,
others ram the gates in panic, chaos all around,
women fling spears from the walls, desperate to save their home,
willing to die first for the city.

turnus, lurking in the forest, hears the meltdown,
word from acca that camilla’s done, the cavalry destroyed,
enemy storming the gates. furious, he abandons his ambush,
just as aeneas crosses the clearing, stepping from the trees.
they both race with full armies to the city, nearly colliding,
but sol is dipping west, day’s final glow.
both camp outside the walls, hungry for dawn’s next brawl.
