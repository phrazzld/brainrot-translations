all the homie-heroes of the pan-achaian crew
were straight up passed out by their beached war-boats,
knocked tf out by that deep-sleep sauce all night.
but *not* our boy aga-meme-non, shepherd of the masses—
no sweet slumber for that big man’s brain, bruh was spiraling.

like when zeus, husband of the hair-slay goddess hera,
starts whipping up thunder plus a full-on torrential meltdown:
maybe infinite rain's about to drop, or hail,
or that zero-chill snow that buries fields,
or he's scheming some war-loud vibe to stun mortal hearts—
that’s how atrides was geeking out inside his chest,
soul trembling, pulse throbbing in straight-up dread.

he glanced out across the trojan plain and saw rowdy bonfires
lighting up the night, heard the Trojan piping and clamor,
then he gazed back at achaeans huddled by the black ships,
and started yanking out hair from his scalp like, “zeus help me,”
groaning from the pit of his stressed-out heart.
finally he decided: better go find nestor, that wise old g.
maybe they can cook up a big-brain plan to keep
all these danaans from catching a game-over.

so he jumped up, slipped on a tunic, laced his fancy kicks,
threw a ruddy-lion pelt over his shoulders (that big alpha-lion drip),
and grabbed his spear.

meanwhile, menelaus, the homie with the war-cry vibes,
couldn't sleep either—worried the argives might take L’s on his account,
since they followed him all the way to troy,
hyped for savage combat.
he layered a flashy leopard print cloak on his back (straight drip),
topped his head with a bronze flex helmet,
then snatched a spear in his thick hand.
he headed out to rouse his big bro, who basically ran the show,
honored like a minor deity among the squad.

he found the older atrides by the stern of his boat,
shouldering his splendid gear, and menelaus was stoked he wasn’t alone.
menelaus broke the ice: “my dude, why you fully armed at this hour?
you about to volunteer someone to do recon on the trojans?
i'm kinda shook because that’s some next-level risky biz—
creeping around trojan lines in the pitch night
is for the dude with the biggest cajones, no cap.”

agamemnon shot back: “bro, i actually need your brains.
we need cunning moves to bail out all the argives,
’cause zeus did a 180 on us and hopped on team hector.
that trojan’s been popping off, best i’ve ever seen—
dude’s pulling stunts i thought only demigods could pull.
the chaos he unleashed on us might keep stinging
for a long, long minute. so let’s hustle.
you run for big ajax and idomeneus by the ships,
i’ll snag nestor, see if he’s down to get on guard duty.
his kid’s posted up there with meriones too,
and they basically run the watch. might as well clue them in.”

menelaus replied, “ok, but do i wait for you
or link up with you again later?
i’m not sure if i should stay put or hustle with you.”

agamemnon said, “nah, man, you stay. we shouldn’t roam around
and end up missing each other in the dark—
just keep shouting commands, get folks up and alert.
call each by their dad’s name, hype them up.
don’t front or hold back, we gotta rally them.
zeus is dropping serious gloom on us.”

so he sent his bro off with some instructions, then beelined
over to nestor, shepherd of the people.
found him next to his hut and his black ship,
asleep in a cushy bed with all his gear near,
the embroidered shield, the pair of spears, the shiny helmet,
a fancy belt-latch that the old warrior strapped on
whenever leading troops to ruin or meltdown.
no old-age retreat for him.

he propped himself on an elbow and asked, “who’s creeping
around the ships alone in this black night while everyone else sleeps?
you on the hunt for a stray ox, or scoping some comrade?
say something, don't just ghost me—what do you want?”

king aga responded: “oh nestor, you champion,
can’t you tell it’s me, atrides agamemnon,
the mortal that zeus decided to bury in heartbreak
until my lungs stop breathing?
i’m out here since i can’t sleep from all these war worries.
the plight of the achaeans is driving me insane.
my heart’s not steady, i’m basically short of breath,
knees shaking in fear. but i see you’re up too, so let’s bounce—
check on the watchers to see if they’re dozing from exhaustion,
’cause trojans are close. they might even strike at night.”

then gerenian horseman nestor was like, “atrides, my man,
chill—zeus might not bless every wild scheme of hector’s.
the trojan’s savage, sure, but i suspect bigger headaches for him
if achilles would just drop his salt.
okay, i’ll come. let’s also rouse diomedes, that star with the spear,
odysseus, fast ajax, and that fearless phyleus kid.
but we also need to holler at greater ajax and king idomeneus,
their ships are parked super far away.
but i gotta roast your bro menelaus a bit—
why is he sleeping while you hustle around alone?
he should be out bugging all the top dogs with you.
we need every big shot on deck, or we’re toast.”

agamemnon sighed, “bro, sometimes i gotta blame you for calling menelaus lazy,
but he’s awake already, beating me to the punch.
i sent him to get ajax and idomeneus.
come on, let’s meet them at the outpost gates.”

nobody was about to front on nestor’s call, so nestor threw on his tunic,
laced his slick sandals, pinned his double-folded cloak (the red one with the fuzz),
took up a dope spear, and walked out among the bronze-shirt achaeans.

first, he found odysseus crashed but not deeply,
’cause just a shout woke him. that cunning legend popped out his hut:
“why y’all wandering in the immortal night while others sleep?
you want something or you scoping a body?”

nestor said, “divine offspring of laertes, odysseus the many-schemed,
don’t judge—pain is slamming the achaeans. come on, let’s wake more peeps.
we need a plan: run or brawl?”

odysseus was game. he grabbed his twisted shield.
they strolled over to diomedes, who was snoozing outside his tent,
armor laid out for quick flex. his homies dozed around him,
shields under their heads, spears jammed upright shining in the night.
the hero dozed on an oxhide, a bright rug beneath his head.
nestor gently nudged him with his foot, teased him:
“yo son of tydeus, you really sleeping the entire night?
didn’t you notice the trojans set up basically on our front porch?”

that jolted diomedes up. “dang, you got no chill, old man.
why not send younger dudes to wake each chief?
but if it’s that urgent, i’m in.”

nestor grinned, “truth, but crisis out here is real.
we’re basically on the razor’s edge—
either a mass funeral for the achaeans or victory.
so get ajax, phyleus’ son. i’m old, pity me.”

tydeus’ boy threw on his big ruddy-lion cloak, snatched his spear,
went and roused those dudes. soon they were at the watchers—
found them all awake in their gear, no one dozing.
like watch dogs in a yard hearing a savage beast in the forest—
baying all night, no sleep—so these watchers kept guard,
vigilant for any trojan stealth approach.
nestor felt big relief and gave them a pep talk, then dipped,
leading the kings to an open spot beyond the ditch,
a place where bodies lay from the day’s savage fights
before hector’s rampage. they all sat down,
and nestor started spinning his lines:

“friends, who’s savage enough to sneak into trojan territory?
maybe catch some straggler, eavesdrop on trojan plans—
whether they plan to keep chilling near our ships
or retreat home since they kinda rattled us.
the intel would be *chef’s kiss*, and the man who pulls it off
would get massive fame plus fancy gifts—
like a black ewe from each leader, best feastable payoff.”

dead silence. then diomedes, that war-cry savage, spoke up:
“my guts are telling me to do it. i’ll sneak in.
but it’d be good if i had a wingman—someone to watch my six.
two brains > one. going solo is kinda sweaty.”

suddenly a bunch of dudes volunteer: the two ajaxes, meriones, nestor’s kid,
menelaus himself, and the fearless odysseus—
he’s always down for shady missions, that man’s heart never folds.

agamemnon said, “diomedes, pick your partner.
choose the best. ignore rank or birth—
just pick the dude with the most OP skill.”
menelaus got a bit anxious, but diomedes was quick:

“honestly, how am i not gonna pick my guy OD?
his gall is unmatched and *athena* vibes with him.
with him at my side, i think we can slip in and out of hell itself.”

odysseus teased, “hey, no more flattery. we both know i’m that cunning star.
time’s ticking, let’s bounce, it’s already late-night prime. most of the night is spent.”

so they geared up: from diomedes, trusty squire gave him a sword,
a shield, and a snug bull’s-hide helmet with no crest or horns, called a “cap helm.”
meriones gave odysseus a bow, a quiver, a blade,
and then a stylin’ boar-tusk helmet, all cunning-stitched inside with straps,
white tusks on the outside, neat and fancy.
this ancient helmet had mad history, stolen by autolycus from eleon,
passed down to meriones, who gave it to odysseus.
once both were decked out, they took off.
athena, bright goddess, flexed a heron to their right, screeching in the dark—
they couldn’t see it but heard the shriek. odysseus felt stoked and prayed:
“hear me, daughter of zeus with the shield. you always back me up.
help me again so we can come back to the ships with a fat dub,
spooking the trojans.”

diomedes prayed second: “listen up, too, goddess.
just like you stood by my dad tydeus when he rolled to thebes,
help me now, and i promise you a young heifer with gilded horns.”
athena heard and gave them her cosmic nod.
they set off through the gloom like two lions sniffing for blood and bodies.

meanwhile, hector wouldn’t let the trojans crash.
he gathered all the top-tier trojan ballers, huddling them up:
“who’s down to do a mission that i’ll pay handsomely for?
i’ll gift them the slickest chariot and horses from achilles’ stash
if they dare slip close to the achaean ships and spy:
are they still manning the watch like usual,
or are they so freaked they plan to bounce at dawn?
the reward is lit, plus you’ll bring major clout.”

nobody said a word, but this dude dolon, son of eumedes, stepped forward.
ugly face but fast feet, overshadowed by five bros.
he piped up: “hector, my soul says do it.
raise your staff, swear i can have achilles’ horses and chariot,
and i’ll slither over to the ships in the black night
to see if they’re bunking guard or about to bounce.”

hector took the staff, swore an oath: “by zeus, thunder-lord,
no trojan but *you* shall ride those unstoppable steeds.”
that sealed dolon’s fate, for real. he slung his bow,
donned a wolfskin, strapped a weirdo cap to his head,
grabbed a javelin, and set off from the trojan lines—
never to return.

odysseus spotted him in the dark, turned to diomedes:
“someone’s stepping out from the trojan mass alone.
maybe scouting or looting. let's let him pass, then jump him.
if he outruns us, i’ll chase him with a spear to herd him back.”

they ducked aside among the corpses as dolon hurried past, clueless.
when he was just a short bowshot away, they sprinted,
like hunting hounds chasing a fawn or hare—
he froze at the sound of their footsteps, hoping they were trojans returning.
but once he realized they were ops, he bolted in terror.
they instantly gave chase.

diomedes roared: “stop or face my spear, bud. i’ll end you quick.”
he chucked his spear intentionally overhead, so it hissed by dolon’s shoulder,
sticking in the ground. dude panicked, face going pale.
they pinned him, tears in his eyes, trembling.
“spare me, i’m loaded. my dad will drop big ransom if i survive.”

odysseus said, “chill. we won't kill you if you give us the tea.
why you creeping through the night alone?
looting corpses or scoping for hector? or is this your own idea?”

dolon babbled: “hector tricked me with a big promise:
achilles’ horses and glittering chariot if i spied on you guys—
if you’re still guarding the ships or planning to flee.
that’s the entire story.”

odysseus smirked: “bro, you wanted those mythical horses, for real?
only achilles can handle them. but ok, spit more:
where’s hector posted? where’s his gear?
what’s the trojans’ watch looking like? do they plan to stand firm or bail?”

dolon spelled it out: “hector’s chilling with the big council near ilus’ tomb,
away from the uproar. there's no strict guard system among the trojans—
some watch the fires if they have no choice.
their allies are all snoozing, trusting trojans to keep watch,
’cause their kids and wives aren’t near.
but i can show you exactly where the newly arrived thracians are posted,
led by king rhesus, son of eioneus.
he’s got the most insane horses—white as fresh snow,
faster than the wind, harness decked in gold and silver.
his armor glitters like a legit god made it—
def not for mortals, more for immortals tbh.
so either drag me to your ships or tie me up here till you verify.”

diomedes gave him a cold stare: “buddy, we can’t risk letting you roam free.
you might come back to spy again or even fight us.
better you die now.”
he tried to beg for mercy, but diomedes slashed his neck with the sword,
cutting tendons, letting him drop.
they stripped him of his weird wolf gear and bow.
odysseus raised it high, dedicating it to *athena*,
praying, “hey goddess, this is for you. hook us up with more spoils.”
he stashed the gear on some tamarisk branches as a marker
so they'd know the spot later.

then they pressed deeper through blood and corpses,
found the thracian camp. dudes were conked out from exhaustion,
weapons neatly arranged in three rows,
horses staked beside each man,
and in the center, king rhesus snoozed near his winged horses,
tied to the last chariot bar.
odysseus nudged diomedes: “that’s the place, that’s the boss, that’s the horses.
dolon wasn’t capping. now go off while i handle the horses.”

pallas athena fueled diomedes with savage energy.
he cut down thracians left and right in the hush of night,
their dying groans painting the ground red.
like a lion pouncing on helpless sheep or goats,
tydeus’ boy rampaged, killing twelve dudes,
while odysseus dragged each corpse aside so the horses wouldn’t freak stepping on them.
then diomedes found rhesus, unlucky number thirteen,
killed him in his sleep thanks to athena’s grim plan.
odysseus unbound the stallions, herded them out with his bow—
didn’t bother with a whip, just tapped them onward.
he signaled diomedes with a whistle.
the hero debated: snatch the fancy chariot or kill more thracians?
but athena whispered in his ear: “bro, think about your exit.
if another god wakes the trojans, y’all will be done.”

he got the hint, leapt onto the back of one of the thracian horses.
odysseus whipped them, they soared toward the achaean ships.
apollo, silver-bowed, saw athena aiding them, got mad,
rushed to wake a thracian captain who discovered the carnage and shrieked.
the trojans roared in alarm, scurrying around in chaos,
but the killers had already gone.

when they reached the spot where they’d killed that trojan lookout,
odysseus reined in the horses. diomedes jumped off,
grabbed dolon’s bloody spoils, hopped back on.
he whipped the horses, and they flew to the achaean lines,
where nestor first heard the thunder of hooves:
“y’all hearing what i’m hearing? might be diomedes and odysseus
bringing back stolen thracian rides.
or maybe trojans snagged them. i sure hope our guys are good.”

he hadn’t finished speaking, and there they were,
dismounting in a swirl of excitement, greeted by their bros.
nestor gushed, “odysseus, how’d you bag these dope horses?
was it a god hooking you up? they’re shining like sunbeams.
i’ve seen trojans up close, i’ve seen you in action,
but never horses like these. must be a divine gift.”

odysseus responded, “wise nestor, if a god wanted,
they could give us even sicker horses, but these are thracian.
diomedes killed their king, plus a dozen of his best men,
and near the ships we took out a trojan scout, dolon—
hector’s lookout.”

laughing, odysseus drove the horses over the trench.
everyone else followed, beaming.
they tied them up in diomedes’ stable,
right where his own lightning-footed mares chomped their barley.
then they dumped dolon’s gore-stained gear by the stern of odysseus’ ship,
saving it for a holy offering to *athena.*

finally, they waded into the sea to wash off the sweat and grime,
scrubbing their ankles, their necks, their thighs.
the salty waves rinsed away the blood, chilling their hearts.
they took a sweet bath in polished tubs, rubbed themselves with oil,
sat down to feast, and poured a luscious libation of wine
to pallas athena, the unstoppable goddess,
who’d carried them through that savage night raid.
