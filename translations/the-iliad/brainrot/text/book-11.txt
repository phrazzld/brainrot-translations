when that rosy-fingered dawn slid outta tithonus's bed, shining all bright for the gods and us mere mortals,
zeus sent big bad strife straight to the swift achaean ships—no lie, she was in her chaos era,
like a walking omen of war, running wild with savage vibes in her hands.
she hopped on odysseus’s massive black-hulled boat (that ride was basically mid-fleet,
so folks on both ends—big ajax’s squad on one side and achilles’s crew on the other—could hear her screaming, fr.
those two had parked their ships at the edge, flexing their insane biceps and battlefield clout.
there strife planted her feet, letting out a truly unhinged war cry,
boosting every achaean’s heart with an unstoppable thirst for battle.
suddenly, heading home sounded boring af: war was the only sweet vibe in their minds.

agamemnon, that top-tier atrides, rallied the dudes with a loud yell, telling 'em to strap on their savage drip,
and he himself suited up with blazing bronze:
first, he wrapped them fancy greaves with silver clasps round his legs,
then slid his dope breastplate on—this epic gift from kinyras,
'cause the cypriot king had heard the clout of achaeans about to sail for troy,
and he wanted to show love to the mighty high king.
the breastplate had ten stripes of deep blue enamel, twelve of gold, twenty of tin,
plus these three serpent-looking patterns on the neck ring, all swirling like rainbows zeus sets in a cloud as a sign for us mortals.
around his shoulders he slung a gold-studded sword with a fancy silver sheath,
then picked up his ornate war-shield, ringed with ten circles of shining bronze,
two dozen knobs of tin, plus a blackish-blue one in the center.
on the front, gorgo with her savage glare stared out, crowned in sheer terror, with fear and dread swirling around.
a silver strap looped around it, with a triple-coiled azure dragon weaving along, sprouting three heads from one neck.
next, he put that four-crested helmet on, horsehair streaming, so the plume nodded menacingly on top.
finally, he grabbed two keen spears with bronze tips that sparkled like they were waving at the heavens,
and athena plus hera threw down a fierce shout, uplifting the king of gold-rich mycenae.

the charioteers kept their horses in check near the ditch, while the foot soldiers formed ranks at dawn’s first light,
and the cavalry lined up a little behind.
zeus let thick drops of blood rain from the sky—super creeps—like a heads-up that so many heroes would soon be sent to hades.

on the trojan side, out on the open plain by the high mound,
stood hector the big-time, polydamas the slick, aeneas revered like a god among trojans,
plus antenor’s three shining sons: polybus, agênor the divine, and akamas who was literally gorgeous like an immortal.
hector strolled in front with a shield that glowed all around,
shining like a star that ducks in and out of cloud cover,
flickering bright, then hidden again—yup, that was our boy,
popping up in the first rank, then darting back to push the rearguard,
his bronze shimmering like zeus’s lightning.

then the armies crashed together, row against row,
like farmers thrashing each other’s lines along the furrows—grain heads tumbling thick and fast—
so trojans and achaean squads jumped at each other, zero fear.
even deadly strife was stoked, the only goddess kicking it among them,
while the rest of the immortals chilled back in olympian crib suites,
all side-eyeing stormcloud zeus for hooking the trojans up with big glory.
zeus didn’t care; he just posted up away from the rest,
watching from the heights of ida, gazing at troy’s walls and the achaean ships,
checking out the shimmering bronze, the falling warriors.

all morning long, the arrows soared, the men dropped,
till the hour that a lumberjack working in the forest decides it’s mealtime—he’s sweaty and done chopping wood,
he’s got that hunger vibe for bread and a break,
that’s the moment the danaans broke the trojan phalanxes with a united roar,
with agamemnon in the lead, snatching first blood:
he took out bianor the shepherd of men and his buddy oïleus the horse-driver.
then left them laid out on the dust, shining in the chest after he peeled their tunics,
and moved on to catch isus and antiphus, priam’s sons, one legit, one bastard, in the same chariot,
they’d once been kidnapped by swift achilles in the foothills of ida but ransomed back,
now they got rekt by wide-ruling atrides.

like a lion pouncing on a helpless fawn while the mama deer stands trembling close but can’t save them—
that’s how the trojans fell before mighty agamemnon,
and even if their buds were near, they were no help; they were panicking.

so then he nailed peisandros and hippolochus, the sons of antimachus (that shady dude who took gold from paris, refusing to give helen back).
the pair hopped off the chariot, trembling, begging for mercy,
offering big ransom from their father’s stash of gold, but agamemnon was savage:
“y’all the spawn of that dirtbag who tried to murder menelaus on a peaceful embassy run. sorry, not sorry, payback time.”
then he slammed peisandros off the chariot, speared him, and took hippolochus’s head right off.
he left them for the dust, pressed forward, swords flashing,
urging the achaean lines on, wreaking havoc.

like unstoppable fire rampaging through a thick forest,
the trojans scattered under atrides's unstoppable push,
their war-chariots rattling empty, horses missing charioteers who now fed vultures more eagerly than their wives.

zeus pulled hector out of the carnage so he wouldn’t get clapped too soon,
while atrides roared on, thirsting for total meltdown,
till they came near the scaean gates and that ancient oak tree,
where trojans paused, parted, and turned to hold ground.
but out in the open field they fled like terrified cows from a lion in the night,
that lion snapping the neck of some poor calf first,
blood-lusting, unstoppable—
that’s how atrides chased them, cutting down the stragglers.

so many bodies fell off their chariots, face-first or on their backs,
while the high king pressed on with his spear thirsting for kills.

but once he was about to breach the city ramparts,
zeus thunder-lord perched on the mountaintop, holding lightning,
and shot off swift iris to deliver a message to hector:
“yo, hold up while that big dog agamemnon is unstoppable.
once he catches an arrow or a spear and dips out,
that’s your cue to get the green light from me,
to crush the achaean lines straight up to their beaked ships.”
iris zipped down from ida to sacred ilion, found hector by his flashy chariot,
spit the father’s words, then vanished.
hector understood, hopped off his ride, and sprinted through the ranks,
fired up the trojans, telling them to stand firm, wait out agamemnon’s big show.

so the fight re-centered, trojans stiffening up, achaean lines firming,
and straight away, king agamemnon flew at them, wanting to lead the charge.

muses who chill on olympus, sing who got clipped first by that unstoppable atrides:
it was ifidamas, antenor’s tall, sturdy boy, raised in fertile thrace by his grandpa cisseus—
he got wifed up, left his bridal bed to chase clout in troy, leading a dozen ships,
but came on foot to fight.
up close with atrides, his spear missed, while the king’s blade struck under the belt,
crashing through the silver-decorated gear,
the poor guy, undone, gasped his last in the dust, never seeing any joy from that marriage, though he paid a hundred oxen for the bride and pledged thousands of goats and sheep.
agamemnon stripped his armor, dragging it out of the line,
but then coon, antenor’s older son, saw his brother fall,
got all big sad, stabbed agamemnon’s arm from behind, slicing below the elbow so bronze parted the flesh.
the king froze in pain but refused to bail, turned and ran him through with a spear,
killed him over ifidamas’s body and cut off his head.
two sons of antenor, gone in that moment,
and agamemnon rampaged on.

while the blood was still hot from the wound, atrides raged unstoppable,
but after it dried and the pang set in,
he started feeling that fierce ache, the kind that hits a woman in labor—
fearsome pangs the childbirth goddesses cast upon her—
that's how the pain swarmed over atrides now,
so he vaulted to his chariot, told his driver to get him out,
and shouted to his achaean bros:
“yo, leaders and lords, keep fighting. zeus ain't letting me slay trojans all day, i gotta bounce.”

his driver whipped the horses to the hollow ships, while the wound throbbed and dripped dustily.

hector saw the big man dip and yelled to his trojans and lycians:
“guys, turn up the heat. the top achaean is leaving the fight. this is our sign for a big W.”
like a huntsman sicking his hounds on a wild boar or lion,
hector launched the trojans at the achaean lines,
leading the charge like a savage war-god, unstoppable as a hurricane slamming the sea.

he iced asaeus, autonous, opites, dolops, opheltius, agelaus, aïsymnos, orestes, and hipponoos, big names in the achaean squads.
like a west wind smashing clouds spun by the south wind,
trojan swords rained on achaean heads.
it was about to get real grim, they almost crashed into the ships,
if diomedes hadn’t hollered to odysseus:
“bro, are we forgetting how to fight? if hector seizes the ships, we’re done.”
and diomedes lunged, spearing thymbraeus from his horse, while odysseus claimed molion.
they turned the tide for a hot minute, letting the fleeing achaean rest a little from hector’s savage chase.

diomedes caught two sons of merops, that prophet who’d warned them not to fight, but the fates had them doomed.
one by one the heroes fell—zeus was balancing the scales from his vantage on ida.
but diomedes singled out agastrophus, a paionian hero who’d wandered too far from his horse,
and that was that.

hector clocked the situation, roared in, and diomedes felt a chill but told odysseus:
“hold up, we gotta hold him off.”
he hurled a spear that clanged off hector’s helmet, but apollo had the trojan’s back—no lethal blow.
hector staggered, black night swirling in his eyes, but got revived and hopped back in his chariot.
diomedes snarled:
“escaped death again, dog, 'cause apollo’s your sugar daddy. next time i might finish you.”
then he started butchering paionians again.

alexander (paris), posted up behind an old tomb, was sniping,
and he pegged diomedes right in the foot, the arrow punching through to the ground.
prince pretty boy jumped out, smirking:
“gotcha. wish i’d shot your gut so you'd croak, you savage.”
diomedes fired back:
“lol stfu, you toy archer. if you tried me up close, your bow wouldn’t save you.”
odysseus shielded diomedes, who yanked the arrow free and hopped on his chariot, hurt but unbroken.

odysseus was alone, all achaeans scattered.
he muttered:
“dang, if i bounce, that’s coward vibes, but if i stay, i might get pinned alone.”
while he wavered, the trojans formed up and crashed in,
like dogs around a cornered wild boar that shows its teeth.
odysseus stabbed deïopites, then thoon and ennomos, took out chersidamas,
but sôkos came up, slid a spear under odysseus’s shield, grazing the ribs.
odysseus realized it wasn’t a kill shot, sneered:
“weak sauce, your time is up.”
he speared sôkos in the back while he turned, dropping him.
but trojans saw odysseus bleeding and closed in.
he backed off, yelling for help. thrice he called, and menelaus heard,
he rushed to ajax:
“bro, odysseus is pinned, we gotta help.”
they found him circled by trojans, like a wounded stag harassed by wolves,
but big ajax parted them with his towering shield, menelaus pulled odysseus away,
while ajax hammered trojans, dropping doryclus, pandocus, lysander, pyrasus, pylartes.
like a raging flood swirling trees and debris, ajax battered horses and men alike.

hector, busy on the left flank by the scamander, smashing lines around nestor and idomeneus,
didn't notice ajax wreaking havoc.
but alexander wounded machaon with a triple-pronged arrow in the shoulder,
and the achaeans freaked, worried they'd lose their top medic.
idomeneus told nestor:
“grab your chariot, whisk machaon back to camp. a doc is worth a ton in a fight.”
nestor drove off with machaon, as his horses sweated under the burden,
while the fight raged.

achilles, standing by his big ship, saw nestor’s chariot pass and recognized machaon,
so he told patroclus, “bro, check if that's machaon, 'cause if he's out, we in trouble.”
patroclus obeyed, sprinting from the tents.

nestor made it to his hut, unhitched the sweaty horses,
and sweet-haired hecamede whipped up a snazzy drink with pramnian wine, grated goat cheese, barley, honey—some next-level nurse’s brew.
they drank, talked about the war, patroclus arrived, and nestor insisted on telling stories about the old days,
like how back in pylon he whooped the epeians.

but patroclus was in a hurry:
“achilles wants to know who’s wounded. is it machaon?”
nestor was like, “why does achilles not care about his people? so many top dogs are hurt: diomedes, odysseus, agamemnon, eurypylus, now machaon.
does he want the ships to burn? guess he forgot that advice from his dad peleus, or from your dad menoetius.
if he’s got some prophecy or mama’s word from zeus, then at least let you lead the myrmidons out and push the trojans back for a sec. or loan you his armor so trojans freak, thinking he’s back. that might buy the achaean squads a breather.”

patroclus’s heart was stirred. he dashed back to achilles,
but along the way he found eurypylus limping from an arrow to the thigh.
feeling pity, he took him to a hut, pulled out the arrow, washed off the black blood,
smashed a bitter root to ease the pain—instantly the wound dried.

thus ended book eleven, with the war swirling savage outside and achilles’s tent about to see heartbreak unfold.
