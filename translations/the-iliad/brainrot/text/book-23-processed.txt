so check it, while trojans bawl inside their walls,
the achaean homies roll up by the ships and the big salt water:
each man splits for his own deck, but achilles, hypebeast of myrmidons,
shuts down any scattering—“listen up, war-loving squad:

“my fast-chariot myrmidons, my real ones, hold your reins,
don’t unyoke those fancy horses just yet. let's roll up to pat’s body,
cry our eyes out—'cause that’s how we do when a homie’s gone.
once we’ve drenched ourselves in sorrow, we’ll stash the horses and feast.”

then came a chorus of wailing: three times around pat’s body
they circled in their gold-trimmed chariots, tears streaming,
thetis stirring that heartbreak in each heart, the sand damp with grief,
and every bronze plate glinting wet with tears for their lost fear-bringer.

achilles, bending over his bestie’s chest, a savage sight, gasps out:
“patroclus, even in hades, i gotta flex for you:
hector’s body i dragged out here, feeding it to dogs raw,
plus i’ll slice a dozen trojan princelings to stoke your pyre.

“catch the vibes, bro, in the land of the dead:
i told you i'd do it—drag hector’s corpse like a prize,
and i’m big mad enough to kill trojan heirs too,
just to keep it real with your shade below.”

so he tosses hector facedown in the dirt, right by the buddy’s bed—
a nasty move, but he’s heartbroken. the troops unwrap their armor,
untie tall-maned horses, swarm around swift achilles’s ship,
where he sets a giant funeral feast: cows bellow around the blades,

sheep bleat, goats cry, thick boars sizzle in the flames,
blood pooling around the dead man in a half-circle of sorrow.
agamemnon and other achaean kings see achilles’s meltdown,
try coaxing him to rinse the gore off, but he’s all “nah, i swore by zeus:

“not washing a drop til i bury my main man pat:
i gotta do the tomb, the locks of hair, all that grief.
maybe then i’ll see bathwater, but for now, i hold this heartbreak.
king, set the men to gather logs at dawn,

“so we can ship him off to hades quick. i’m sick seeing him like this.
then the rest can do their own tasks—this funeral’s on me.”
they nodded, devoured dinner, nobody lacking appetite,
and all crashed in their tents except achilles, who laid near the roaring surf

with his day-one myrmidons. the waves lapped the shore,
and sweet sleep finally snatched him, melting his stress—
he was drained from chasing hector around windy ilion.
then pat’s ghost popped up, same tall vibe, same fresh face,

same gear, standing over achilles’s head, whispering:
“bro, you snoozin’? you forgot me so soon?
didn’t think you’d ditch me so quick, i’m stuck outside hades’s gates,
the other shades say i can’t cross till i’m properly buried.

“help a ghost out—burn my body asap.
once the pyre is lit, i can’t come back,
so gimme your hand, let me hold it one last time.
also, bury our bones together in the same golden jar—

“’cause your pops raised me since i was small,
after i did that accidental kill. we grew side by side,
and i’ve been your shadow. so keep me close even in death.”
achilles jumped up, tried to hug that phantom shape—

it drifted through his arms like dark smoke. he wailed,
slapped his palms, groaning: “guess there is an afterlife shade.
i just saw pat—he told me stuff—looked the same, but no real body.”
everyone else heard and fell back into tears,

til dawn with rosy fingers glowed over the pitiful corpse.
agamemnon told men to hit the hills for lumber,
meriones leading with axes, ropes, and donkey teams.
they clambered up rugged slopes, dropping tall timbers with echoing crash,

then hauled them back through the dense brush to the beach,
set them where achilles had staked pat’s funeral site.
achilles told his myrmidons: “strap that bronze on,
hitch each set of horses, we’re taking pat to his last bed.”

they marched in front, a swirl of foot soldiers behind,
patroclus riding in the middle, covered in cut hair the men had shaved,
achilles trailing, crying big tears for his day-one homie.
they reached the spot, built up a huge pyre,

achilles paused, cut a golden lock meant for spercheios the river,
gazing out at the wine-dark sea: “river, my dad pledged i’d bring
my hair and a grand sacrifice if i got home safe—
but that ain’t happening, so pat, take this hair instead.”

the tears kept rolling, achaean hearts on meltdown.
achilles said, “no more moaning—time to handle the burn.
line up the logs, place him on top, then tomorrow we feast.
we gotta let the sorrow lighten a bit.”

they parted except the wood-cutting crew,
who made a hundred-foot pyre, high all around,
laid pat’s corpse across it. achilles layered fat from many beasts,
piled honey and oil jars, then chucked in four stallions,

slit the throats of two hounds, even a dozen trojan princes,
in a savage fury. he fed the flames with blazing iron,
then roared out, “pat, see me do it all for you—
the trojan heirs burn with you, but i’m letting dogs shred hector.”

yet aphrodite saved hector’s flesh from the dogs,
anointed him with rose ambrosia oil, so no dragging would tear him,
while apollo wrapped a dark cloud round the corpse
to shield it from scorching sun. still, pat’s pyre wouldn’t catch right:

achilles prayed off to the winds, promising big sacrifices
if they’d blow on that wood. iris carried the plea,
and soon north and west winds blasted in, roaring,
churning the sea with screaming gusts, then hammered the pyre

all night long. achilles poured out wine on the sand,
calling pat’s spirit like a father mourning his only son.
by dawn, the flames died, the winds parted,
the tide groaned with heavy foam. achilles, drifting from the pyre,

finally caught a quick rest. but the crowd’s clamor woke him.
he stood up, told the host: “pour wine to kill leftover embers,
collect pat’s bones from the center, the rest got mixed:
store them in gold until i join him, then build a tomb

“that’s modest, and if you want, you can enlarge it after i’m gone.”
they did it, dousing the ash with wine,
lifting the precious bones in a golden bowl,
wrapped in soft cloth and placed in his tent,

raised up a small mound and headed back.
achilles then set up epic funeral games,
laying out tripods, cauldrons, thoroughbred horses,
sturdy mules, shining cows, and captive women, plus lumps of iron.

first, a chariot race: champion gets a top-tier lady plus a big tripod,
second gets a pregnant mare, third a brand-new cauldron,
fourth a chunk of gold, fifth a sweet bowl.
achilles says, “any speed demons, line up.

“i’m out—my immortal horses are grieving for pat.”
so diomedes, eumelus, menelaus, antilochus, and meriones hopped in.
lots got drawn, they cracked whips, dust soared in plumes,
chariots sometimes hugging the ground, sometimes leaping high.

eumelus led early, diomedes breathing on his neck,
so close his own horses’ heads brushed eumelus’s back,
diomedes might’ve passed him but apollo knocked the whip,
making him cry in frustration.

athena stepped in, gave him a new whip and supercharge,
while messing up eumelus’s chariot, snapping the yoke so he spilled.
diomedes thundered ahead, menelaus behind,
antilochus right behind that, pushing his dad’s team:

“come on, fellas, we can’t let menelaus style on us!”
he sees a narrow gap, whips the horses around menelaus,
who freaks out about a collision.
antilochus storms forward, menelaus forced to slow,

cursing him for being reckless. but menelaus soon whipped
his own horses, staying within a disk’s throw.
back at the watchers, idomeneus spots the leaders,
ajax of oïleus trash-talks him but they see diomedes is definitely first.

finally diomedes skids to a stop in a swirl of dust,
jumps down, sthenelus snags the prizes: the lady and shining tripod.
antilochus squeaks into second, menelaus nearly overlapping,
meriones is fourth, and last is poor, dusty eumelus.

achilles pities eumelus and wants to gift him a special prize,
antilochus says “cool, but don’t snatch my rightful stuff—
you have plenty of treasure. fling him some other fancy gift.”
achilles shrugs, tosses eumelus a sweet breastplate.

menelaus publicly scolds antilochus for the shady driving,
antilochus apologizes, hands over his own horse to menelaus,
who forgives him, saying “your old man did me solids, so i won't stay mad.”
so that’s the race.

next: bareknuckle boxing. winner gets a strong mule,
loser gets a two-handled cup. epeios stands up bragging
he’ll drop anybody. euryalos challenges with diomedes cheering him on.
they wrap up their fists, epeios clobbers euryalos’s jaw,

the dude flops on the ground like a fish on the shore,
blood spurts, epeios lifts him, the friends drag him away,
gasping, spitting red clots. the big man collects his mule.
then achilles sets the heavy wrestling match,

first prize a big tripod, second a skilled woman.
ajax the huge and odysseus the cunning face off,
grappling with locked arms, sweaty, trembling,
the crowd enthralled but no one sees a clear winner.

achilles calls it: “tie, y’all split the prizes, next event.”
footrace next: a beautiful silver bowl for first, big bull for second,
gold chunk for third. up steps swift ajax, odysseus, antilochus.
they sprint. ajax leads early, odysseus inches behind,

close as a spinning woman’s spool to her chest.
odysseus prays to athena, who helps him while ajax slips
in stray cow dung, face-plant. odysseus breezes in for the win,
ajax takes second, caked in muck, antilochus third,

still joking: “ajax is older, but no one outruns achilles in youth.”
achilles laughs, hands antilochus a gold sweetener.
then the spear bout in full gear: winner gets that thracian sword,
the armor is shared. ajax and diomedes cross blades,

both savage, unstoppable. the achaeans break it up:
“tie again, guys, but let’s hand diomedes the blade.”
so diomedes straps that silver-studded sword, big grin.
achilles lifts a chunk of raw pig iron for the next toss,

polypoites, leonteus, ajax, epeios all hurl. polypoites sends it flying
like a herdsman’s staff, the crowd roars, they haul the iron to his tent.
now archery: a tethered dove from a tall mast,
ten double axes for hitting the bird, ten half-axes for hitting the string.

teucer fires first, misses the dove but cuts the string,
bird flutters free. meriones nails its wing, it drops to the sand,
he claims the double axes, teucer gets the half.
last event: the spear, plus a fine cauldron.

agamemnon and meriones step up,
achilles basically says, “agamemnon, you’re top dog, just take the cauldron,
and let meriones have the spear if you want.”
agamemnon’s cool with that, so it’s done.

thus ended achilles’s funeral games for his beloved friend,
patroclus, gone too soon, but honored in epic style.
