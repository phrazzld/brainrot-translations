once we loaded the boat, crying big salty tears not even gonna lie,
we shoved her back into the brine, hoisted the mast, stashed our bleating flock,
then all hopped aboard looking real depressed. next-level gloom.
circe, that prime goddess with the bomb hair, sent a perfect tailwind
to puff our sails, spamming good vibes behind us. so we just chilled,
the helmsman steering, the breezy aura guiding us all day,
till the sun dipped low and the roads of twilight took over.

we reached the far rim of the ocean’s flow—
the land of the cimmerians, stuck in permanent shadow,
like their sun is fully ghosting them 24/7, no glow, big yikes.
the horizon there is all gloom, zero chance for a solar cameo.
we beached the ship, led out the sheep, then walked up the riverbank
to the spot circe pegged for us. time to pop off with the necro-ritual.

my homies pinned the sacrifices, i dug a trench the size of a man’s forearm span,
poured sweet liquids—milk with honey, then luscious wine, and water for the third—
sprinkled barley, prayed hardcore to the ghostly masses.
i vowed a prime cow back home, loaded with best offerings,
and a special pitch-black ram for teiresias alone.
then slit the throats so blood dribbled into the pit; next moment,
legions of ghostly shades swarmed around, moaning from the underworld,
all types—girls, dudes, ancient geezers, warriors still rocking bloody gear—
the chorus gave me goosebumps tbh. i told the homies:
“burn them offerings, pray real nice.” i brandished my blade,
blocking any spirit from sipping that blood before we talked to teiresias.

first to appear was elpenor, my day-one who got wasted
and fell off circe’s roof like an absolute clown, snapping his neck.
we left him unburied, which kinda sucks, but we had bigger crises.
seeing him in ghost form, i shed tears: “bro, how’d you get down here so fast?!”
he gave me a sad shrug: “look, a demon’s whim + too much wine wrecked me.
i forgot not to fling myself off the roof, major skill issue, my guy.
so i beg you, if you ever go back to circe’s island, don’t ditch me unburied—
i don’t wanna haunt you with curses. burn me properly,
plant my oar on the mound so people know i was that random unfortunate boater.”
i told him, “bet, i’ll do it. i’m sorry, fr.”

while we chatted, i clutched my sword so the ghost couldn’t come near the blood.
then up rolled my mother’s shade—anticleia, daughter of autolycus—
she was alive last i’d known, but apparently not anymore.
my heart ached, but i wouldn’t let her sip that blood first.
gotta do business with teiresias, you feel me.

then he arrived, the goat seer from thebes, staff in hand,
recognized me right away: “odysseus, man, you mortal men have it rough.
why you stepping into these depressing depths, the land of no fun?
chill back so i can drink the blood and tell you the real tea.”
i stashed my sword, he gulped that thick red fluid,
and the prophecy started:

“your homecoming’s gonna be savage, poseidon’s big mad
‘cause you messed with polyphemus, his giant cyclops son.
still, if you can keep your thirst in check, plus your men’s stupidity,
maybe you survive. you’ll reach thrinacia, where helios’s holy cows graze,
don’t you dare eat them. if you skip the steak buffet, you might limp home.
but if you mess with those cows, it’s game over—ship wrecked, crew gone.
you might survive alone, returning late and broken. find suitors
chowing down your wealth, hitting on your queen. you’ll kill ‘em all, obviously,
through trickery or straight swords. after that, you gotta do a random quest:
take your oar and travel far inland where they know nada about the sea,
till some rando sees your paddle and says, “dude, that looks like a winnowing-fan.”
plant it there, sacrifice to poseidon a ram, a bull, and a wild boar,
then head home, offer big feasts to all the gods. that’s your job.
death will come softly from the sea in your old age,
with your people safe around you. that’s no cap. i swear.”

i was like, “dang, guess i gotta trust the cosmic script. but hey, tell me,
why is my mom ghosting me so hard right there by the blood?”
teiresias said, “easy fix, just let whoever you want approach the pit.
any spirit you block with your sword has to bounce.”
with that, the seer left for hades’s halls, having delivered the vibes.

i stood my ground, waiting for my mom. once she drank that blood,
she recognized me, crying: “child, how’d you stroll here alive?
it’s insane for mortals to peek behind the grave’s curtain.
did you not get home? did your wife not see you? are you still lost?”
i explained how i’d come, forced by the prophecy hustle, not that i wanted to.
then i asked about her death, about dad, about my son.
mom said penelope’s still waiting, weeping day and night,
my father lost in grief out in the fields, no fancy bed, just dust and sorrow.
he’s basically withering away. as for me, she died not from sickness or a direct arrow from artemis,
but from heartbreak. longing for me basically sucked her soul away.

my gut clenched. i thrice tried to hug her, thrice my arms clutched empty air.
i was big sad. “why you vanish, mother? let me hold you, even if we’re in hades.”
she told me: “it’s how mortal shadows work, dear. after the body goes up in funeral flames,
the soul drifts off like a dream. blame the gods, but i can’t do more.”
she advised me to dash back to the sunlight asap.
and that’s basically that, fam.
