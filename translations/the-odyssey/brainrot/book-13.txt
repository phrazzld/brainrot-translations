yap to me, divine hypebeast muse, of that supreme comeback
when the big-brain odysseus, king of side-eyes and savage retorts,
wrapped his meltdown tales in alcinous’s hall, where the crowd was hushed
like, “no cap, that story’s fire,” stuck in the vibe of his every word.

alcinous, mind-on-the-bag, that lord of rowdy phaeacians,
spoke up, dropping orders: “all y’all who sip wine in my boujee hall,
who jam to demodocus’s bops on the daily,
come through: let’s top the hero’s stack with even more glow,
a big-bronze tripod or an epic kettle. we’ll crowd-fund it, besties—
the man’s survived so many l’s, might as well leave him big-living.”

the squad like “bet,” then slipped away to the soft sheets of night.
but when rosy-fingered dawn booped the sky with pastel flares,
they rallied, hauling that fresh metal to the black-hulled ship.
alcinous, boss moves, stashed it all under the benches,
so no random creeper scuffed the new merch when oars started to flex.

meanwhile, up at his porch, a next-level bull got sacrificed,
zeus’s name invoked (cloud-gathering goat of the gods),
their feast was lit, tunes from demodocus swirling sweet,
but odysseus’s eyes cut the sun like, “wrap it up, yo,”
dude was done with chillin’, he needed home vibes asap.

like a poor farmland drudge, who spent the day whipping plow-oxen
and begs for dusk to land so he can munch, then crash—
that’s our guy odysseus, craving that sweet nightfall,
dreaming of the moment he can bounce from this palace with his loot.

he stands, addresses alcinous the top-tier royal:
“big man, i’m so thankful. you saw me battered and said ‘i gotchu.’
bless you and your fam with zero skill issues.
i’ve got my tri-pods, my clothing drip, that sweet gold.
lemme dip, besties. i left wifey waiting, and i’m big eager to vibe in ithaca again.”

the crowd nodded “say less,” so pontonoos mixed the wine,
passing it round the hall for final sips to zeus.
odysseus held a fancy double cup out to queen arete:
“boss-lady, keep shining, watch your kiddos flex,
and keep being main-character energy in phaeacia.
i’m out.” so he stepped across the threshold,
while the herald guided him to the swift vessel.

arete’s maids carried the hamper, the robes, the bread, the wine,
and the rowers got that bed setup on the stern—
they stashed him there, lulled by the hush, roped the goods in place,
while odysseus conked out, a savage slumber that smacked
like a meltdown undone—he drifted to dreamland harder than any toddler.

the phaeacians manned the benches, yo,
their oars rose and fell in perfect synergy,
the prow soared like horses in full gallop across a wide field,
spraying foam as the great wave parted behind them,
and not even a hawk (fastest wings in the game) could keep up.

thus did they speed, carrying the hero with god-tier cunning,
he who’d bled through war-torn trojan nights, then storms so cringe.
now, at last, free of nightmares, he snoozed away,
forgotten pains drifting behind the thick hush of the sea.
when the morning star winked high, herald of pink dawn,
the ship ghosted in near phorcys’s cove, that secret nook in ithaca,
flanked by jagged headlands cutting all savage winds.
no ropes needed there—ships just vibe.
an olive tree stood overhead, plus a dank nymph-cave
where bees made honey, and stone looms lay for weaving watery wonders.

silently they ran the keel up half the beach,
lifted snoozing odysseus off and set him on the sand
with all his loaded drip, courtesy of alcinous’s generosity.
they stashed it under the trunk so no random stole it,
then hopped back aboard, headed for home.
but poseidon, still salty, side-eyed them: “wtf, they out here
flexing on me, letting mortals disrespect the sea-lord? bffr.”

he petitioned zeus, all meltdown vibes,
zeus was like, “bro, do as you wish, you’re the big wave boss.”
so poseidon smacked the phaeacian ship mid-route,
solidifying it into a stone statue in the swell.
on shore the phaeacians gawked, “holy glitch, we got stoned.”
everyone recalled the prophecy of a mountain cloaking the city,
and alcinous said, “be real, that day’s arrived. no more escort freebies,
let’s sacrifice a bunch of bulls to poseidon, maybe we’ll dodge the worst.”

so while the phaeacians freaked and prayed,
odysseus woke on ithaca’s soil but didn’t even know it—
athena’s thick mist had sussed him out. he moaned,
“did they do me dirty? i was told i’d reach ithaca, but i see…
fog. some foreign beach? where even am i? maybe they scammed me.”

he counted his goodies: all there, safe.
still he hissed about unknown terrain, crawling the shore in gloom.
then bright-eyed athena, shaped like a fresh-faced shepherd boy,
strolled up—odysseus is like, “yo, bestie, help a guy with no map.
tell me what island i’m on, or if it’s a chunk of mainland. i’m big lost.”

the goddess teased: “why so clueless, traveler?
everyone knows ithaca, though it’s rocky and no thoroughbred paradise,
it’s sure unstoppable for goats and wine and nymph-lore.
buddy, you’re home.” and she winked.

the man of wiles fibbed more with some random crete story,
testing the field. but athena smirked,
“dang, you’re top-tier cunning, you’d juke a god,
but i’m that goddess who taught you half your shady moves.
recognize me: pallas athena, your day-one ally in troy.
this is indeed your yard, this cozy cove, that nymph cave,
that olive overhead. so check your meltdown, fam: you’re back.”

he kissed the ground, praising the nymphs, praising the space.
athena said, “stash that loot. we got shady suitors up in your crib,
draining your wine, hitting on your queen. i’ll cloak you as a crusty old beggar
so they won’t see you coming. go find eumaeus, swineherd with a loyal heart.
meanwhile, i’ll fetch telemachus from sparta, your sweet boy out questing for rumors of dad.”

odysseus nodded, “y’all coulda just told him i’m alive, smh.”
she brushed it off: “he’s vibing at menelaus’s palace, zero danger.
the suitors try to ambush, but they’ll flop.”
then she tapped him with her staff:
his hair shriveled, his skin got wrinkly,
his eyes dulled, she cloaked him in trash rags and a gross tunic.
straight hobo mode engaged.

thus parted the cunning hero and the grey-eyed goddess,
she soared to sparta to retrieve the son,
while odysseus, incognito, readied for the final showdown
with those clown suitors lording it up in his own hall.
