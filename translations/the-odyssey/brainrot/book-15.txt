yooo, athena bounce-stepped straight to sparta’s boujee halls,
still big pressed that telémachus (son of the og goat odysseus)
had been vibin’ away from home too long. sis had receipts:
she found him crashed in the entryway with nestor’s shining spawn,
both chilling in menelaus’ domain—though nestor’s boy was out cold,
deep in that beauty sleep, no cap.
but telémachus? homie couldn’t even get a power nap in,
‘cause his heart was heavy missing dad, stuck in that am meltdown mental.
so pallas athena slides up on him, hits him with a "bestie, fyi":

“telémachus, big yikes, you’re still posted here?
while your orchard flex and your house back in ithaca just stay unguarded,
clout-hungry suitors are probably mid rampage, ready to munch your bag.
trust, you do not want to come home to zero goodies left.
time to bffr and ask menelaus, the boán-agathós (the dude with the big voice),
to expedite that flight home, so you can see your mom.
lowkey, your uncles and gramps might be speedrunning her marriage to eurymachus—
‘cause he’s drippin’ with gifts, practically bribing the entire suitor squad,
and your mom, queen penelope, might fold if you ghost too long.
not that she’s fickle asf, but c’mon, you know how the vibe is with ladies—
once a new bae upgrades the situation, they might forget the old one.
so hustle home, supervise your entire household,
hand-pick a real one from your staff who’ll have your aura on lock,
until the gods place a new wifey by your side.

“also, heads-up: them suitor ops are camping in the watery crossing
between ithaca and samé’s rocky shores, setting up a huge L for you if they can.
but tbh i see them flopping. they’re mid, you’re based.
still, maybe take a route that’s out-of-pocket for them,
sail at night, let the immortal homies fling you a tailwind.
when you first wash up on the beaches of ithaca,
have your crew dock the black ship in the city, then you personally
make a beeline to that boar-boss eumaeus, the goat swineherd,
who vibes in your orchard. crash with him for the night,
then dispatch him to lady penelope with the good news that you’re safe.

“that’s the tea.”
with that, the goddess dipped to olympus.
telémachus woke nestor’s boy with a gentle poke, whispering:
“hey písistratus, can we hitch the horses and bounce? no time to loaf.”
dude’s all like, “bro, it’s pitch black, we can’t just race home in the dark.
let’s wait for dawn; menelaus wants to flex us with parting gifts
and a pleasant wave-off. that’s hospitality.”
sure enough, next morning’s glow-up: menelaus, the golden-haired king,
rolled out of bed from helen-of-the-slay’s side,
saw telémachus stirring, already strapping on a brand-new cloak,
and telémachus was, “my lord menelaus, real talk, gotta secure my bag home.
my vibe says i gotta get back.”

menelaus, big-voice boán-agathós, replied:
“no shade, young king. i don’t gatekeep guests.
some hosts are cringe controlling, but that’s not me.
still, let me set you up with a gift, something truly drip.
i’ve got a luscious silver mixing-bowl with gold rims,
made by hephaestus—pháidimos the sidonian king gave it to me,
and now i’m paying that forward.”

so menelaus hands him the double-cupped goblet, shining asf,
megapénthês, menelaus’s seed, brings out a gleaming silver bowl,
while queen helen steps up with a tapestry, self-woven,
big slay, shining like a star in a midnight fit.
she addresses telémachus: “take this, bestie, a keepsake from helen
for your future bae, so she can serve iconic looks.
until then, stash it safe with your mom.
may you get back to your home in one piece.”

telémachus is big grateful. písistratus loads the gifts,
they step to menelaus’s feast area again, recline on fancy seats,
some boss handmaid pours water from a golden pitcher over a silver bowl
to wash their hands, sets out a loaded table: bread, meats, wine, the works.
they feast and vibe. soon as they’re done, the duo hit the road—
they harness their horses, hop in the chariot, menelaus trailing behind
with a gold cup of sweet wine to do a final “sip n’ send-off.”
menelaus speaks: “safe travels, kiddos, and tell nestor i said hi—
he was like a father to me in troy.”

telémachus says, “bet, i’ll pass the message.
if i find my dad at home in ithaca by some miracle,
i’ll for sure hype your generosity—gift city.”

just then an eagle slices by on the right,
clutching a giant white goose from the yard in its talons—
men and women are chasing but it’s too late, the bird soared off.
everyone is stoked; nestor’s boy goes, “king menelaus,
did that sign drop for you or me?”

he’s about to big-brain it, but helen steps in elegantly:
“lemme interpret that: just like the eagle yanked a well-fed goose
straight from the yard, i bet odysseus will pop up at home,
clap them suitors, and retake his domain. periodt.”

telémachus is like, “asl, i hope that’s legit.
i’d basically worship apollo if that prophecy is for real.”

he flicks the whip, horses thunder across the plain,
and they keep it moving all day, all night,
stopping for the night at the house of diocles in phêrai, who hooks them up.
next morning, they’re off again, galloping until they reach pylos.
then telémachus pulls nestor’s son aside, "bro, do me a solid:
don’t drag me to nestor’s palace. he’s a real one, but i’m in a rush,
and the old man might guilt-trip me into a forced linger.
drop me near my boat, peace out.”

písistratus stans his boy, drives him straight to the black ship,
pulls out the gifts from menelaus, and sends telémachus on with good vibes:
“hustle up, man, before nestor knows what’s what. i gotta bounce.
that man is unstoppable if he tries to keep you.”

so písistratus heads back to the city, while telémachus rallies the crew:
“stow the gear, homies, let’s get out.” they hop aboard.
he prays to athena as they prep. suddenly a random man shows up—
he’s théoclymenos, from a line of seers, on the run ‘cause he murked a cousin.
he begs telémachus, “brah, help a fugitive out, or i’m cooked.”

telémachus says, “bet, hop on. i got you. no cap.”
he seats théoclymenos by the stern, stows the spear,
and commands the squad to free the ship from moorings.
they hoist the mast, tighten the rigging, let the white sails flap.
athena blesses them with a whippin’ tailwind, so they slice through the salty foam.
they pass krounoi, chalkis with its pretty streams,
the sun sets, the watery roads darken, but the ship speeds on,
around elis and the epeians’ domain, then on to the islands.
fate’s in flux—will he die or survive suitor drama? stay tuned.

cut scene to the swineherd’s shack,
where the incognito odysseus and eumaeus feast on hogs with other workers.
once they’re stuffed, odysseus, still in beggar drip, tests eumaeus:
“bruh, tomorrow i’m hitting the city to do my beggar hustle.
don’t want to mooch off your vibe. just point me the route,
maybe i can link with queen penelope or blend in with the suitors.
i can busk some free bread, maybe handle chores for them—
lowkey i’m handy at roasting meat, pouring wine, you name it.
hermes is my day-one, gave me that party skill.”

eumaeus roasts him back, “dude, that’s a delulu move.
the suitors are savage: young, rude, iced out in fancy fits, no respect.
they are all about draining the household, stunting on penelope,
and humiliating lesser men. so i say: bffr.
stay here, no stress, till telémachus comes home.
he’ll sort you out with fresh clothes, a safe path, everything.”

odysseus responds, “bestie, you a real one.
the gods put me in your orbit so i wouldn’t starve.
but hey, i got questions: is odysseus’s mom still breathing?
and what about old laertes, his father? do they still catch sunrise, or nah?”

eumaeus: “both alive, but wishing for death.
laertes is big sad since his wife died from heartbreak—
missing odysseus broke her.
she raised me side by side with her youngest daughter,
treated me almost like a prince. then i grew, she married off that daughter,
and i was sent to the fields to herd.
now i hardly see the inside scoop. the suitors overshadow everything.
the staff can’t ask about penelope or scrounge freebies.
that’s the vibe.”

odysseus, stirred by eumaeus’s backstory, goes, “dang,
so how’d you end up here, parted from your homeland?
did pirates snatch you, or was your city sacked?”

eumaeus: “lemme unravel this tea:
there’s an island called syrie, above ortygia, near where the sun flips.
not big, but dank—fat goats, lush farmland, sweet wine, plenty grain.
nobody starves, no diseases plague them,
and once folks get old, apollo and artemis gently snipe them with easy arrows.
my father was king there, ctésios, basically a local goat.
then some phoenician scoundrels rolled up with a boat of cheap trinkets.
we had a phoenician house-servant, gorgeous and cunning,
these sly sailors seduced her while she was washing clothes by the ship—
they asked about her story, she spilled it: she was from sidon, loaded family,
but got kidnapped by taphian pirates and sold to my dad.
one of the phoenician bros said, ‘pull up with us,
we’ll get you home. your folks still alive, hella wealthy.’
she’s down to get smuggled out, but demands an oath so she won’t get played.
they swear. she says, ‘keep hush until you load the ship.
then let me know so i can bring gold, plus i’ll toss in a baby boy i watch—me.
they can flip me for bigger profit overseas.’
they do it, fill the ship for a year,
finally send a messenger; she nabs three gold trinkets, stashes them,
pulls me by the hand out of the house at dusk,
we slip down to the harbor, and we set sail.
but day six or seven in, artemis iced her with an arrow.
they tossed her overboard for fish bait,
and i was alone, sobbing. next, the wind blew us to ithaca,
where laertes purchased me with his stash.
that’s how i arrived.”

odysseus goes, “whew, that’s savage. you had it rough.
still, you landed in a loyal home, so i guess that’s something.”

they chat all night, barely sleeping,
dawn creeps in with rosy fingertips.
meanwhile, telémachus’s crew is nearing ithaca at daybreak.
they row into the harbor, drop sails, anchor up,
set out a meal. after munchies, telémachus stands and says:
“y’all sail the ship to the city. i’m bouncing to the fields to see my herds.
i’ll join you at sundown. tomorrow we feast. then you can all disperse.”

théoclymenos steps up: “uh, friend,
where am i supposed to crash if you’re ghosting for the countryside?
maybe i should hit your mom’s place?”

telémachus: “bro, i’d def host you if i wasn’t out.
mom’s dealing with them suitors, and she’s rarely front-and-center—
she basically hides upstairs weaving.
you could try eurymachus, polýbos’s son, top suitor rn,
but idk if that’s a vibe. plus, the gods might have an L for them soon.
anyway, your call.”

an omen: a hawk from apollo’s sky rips a dove midair,
feathers raining between the ship and telémachus.
théoclymenos pulls him aside: “this sign is straight from the gods,
i sense your lineage is forever boss in ithaca.”

telémachus says, “hope so. i’d spoile you with gifts if that’s true.”
then he tells his homie peiraios, “dude, please host this prophet
till i get back. treat him well, and i’ll make sure you’re repaid.”
peiraios: “don’t sweat it. i’ll keep him secure.”

so they all hop on the ship, sail toward the city.
telémachus straps on his sharp bronze spear, leaps to the shore,
and speeds away, soon reaching the pig-sty orchard,
where eumaeus is minding an entire vibe of swine,
loyal as always, waiting for his true king to appear.
