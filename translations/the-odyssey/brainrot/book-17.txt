yooo so at the crack of that rosy-finger dawn, telemachus
laced up his fresh kicks and grabbed his savage spear,
about to dip into the city. he goes, “ay eumaeus, dad/mom-level vibes,
imma bounce to the crib so my mom can stop weeping
24/7. you know she stay meltdown mode till she sees me.”

then he’s like, “oh, and bring that dusty stranger dude
to town so he can do his beggar hustle, maybe snag some bread,
‘cause i can’t feed the entire planet all by myself, no cap.
if he’s big salty about it, that’s on him—
he’s gotta put up or shut up.”

odysseus, still incognito as a crusty old guy, is like,
“bro, no worries, i get it. it’s time for me to scrounge in the city.
i’d rather snag some coins from randoms than mooch out here forever.
just let me warm up by the fire a bit so i don’t freeze.
man’s got these suspect rags on, big brr.”

tele machi dips, leaving scheming suitors in his mental wake.
he strolls into the swanky palace, props his spear by a tall pillar,
and old nurse eurykleia is the first to see him. she freaks out,
happy-crying, and the other maids follow, hugging and kissing him.

penelope emerges from her chamber, basically looking like
“if artemis and aphrodite had a baby,” hugging telemachus,
sobbing about how she was so sure he’d never come back from pylos.
he’s like, “ma, chill. let me do my business at the assembly hall.
also, i gotta fetch a guest who rolled with me on the ship.”
penelope’s like, “fine, i’ll keep praying that zeus stops messing with us.”

boom, telemachus heads out, flanked by two swift dogs,
athena sprinkles extra sparkle on him, and all the folk in the streets
are like “dang, that’s a main character if i ever saw one.”
the suitors gather ‘round, smiling to his face but definitely
thinking some sus stuff inside.

telemachus breezes past them to link up with mentor, antiphus, & halitherses—
some real ones from back in the day—while peiraios rolls up
with the traveler theoclymenos in tow.
peiraios is like, “yo, telemachus, you want me to bring those menelaus gifts
now, or wait?” telemachus is all, “we gotta see how it goes,
these suitors might off me and loot everything. if i beat them?
i’ll come claim it with hype.”

then telemachus takes theoclymenos home. they do the bath + fresh clothes routine,
serve that top-tier bread, wine, meat, the works.
penelope’s off to the side, spinning threads, listening for news.

finally they’re done eating, and she’s like, “son, i’m dying to hear about
your dad’s fate. cough it up.” telemachus retells the whole story: pylos, nestor,
how nestor had no real tea on odysseus, so he shipped telemachus to menelaus,
the spartan goat, who recounted how the old man’s stuck on calypso’s island.

theoclymenos then jumps in like,
“ay, queen penelope, i swear on everything, i read the vibes:
odysseus is already on ithaca, sneaking around. suitors are so done.”
penelope is hopeful but also big depressed.
the suitors, meanwhile, are out front javelin-throwing and messing with discs,
waiting to come feast again.

when dinner time hits, medon the herald summons them indoors
for the nightly munch. they go in, recline on fancy seats,
slaughter sheep, goats, hogs, and a nice cow for the feast.
cut scene: back in the country, eumaeus is like, “buddy, hey old ‘beggar’ friend,
time to head into the city. telemachus said so. i’m not tryna
catch heat from my boss.”

odysseus is like, “cool beans, i just need a walking stick ‘cause I might catch a slip
on this rough road. also i got these busted clothes, so yeah.”
he hoists his patched-up sack on his shoulders, eumaeus hands him a staff,
and they set off while the other swineherds and dogs hold down the fort.

on the road, by that sweet spring where the city folks draw water,
they run into melanthius, the goat-herd jerk, who sees odysseus in rags and spits,
“ew, what’s this crusty clown you dragging, eumaeus?
some bottom-tier beggar about to mooch off our feast?
he’d be better hauling goat fodder for me, maybe get some real
food instead of scrounging. watch out, if he sneaks near odysseus’s place,
he might get a savage beating.”
then he cheap-shots odysseus with a kick, but it’s not strong enough to knock him over.
odysseus contemplates caving the guy’s skull, but holds it in. eumaeus curses him out,
praying odysseus will come home and wreck his life.

melanthius basically curses telemachus too, hoping apollo kills him,
then struts off to feast with the suitors.
odysseus and eumaeus keep walking. as they reach the palace,
they hear the harp and singing from phemius the bard.
odysseus looks around: “dang, bro, this place is big fancy.
lots of folks inside feasting, singing, the whole shebang.”

eumaeus is like, “yep, that’s the house of the goat, odysseus,
but watch your step with these braindead suitors. let me go in first
in case some fool tries to pop off.”
odysseus is like, “bet, i’ll hang back. i’ve survived worse, so i can handle
a little suitor meltdown. anyway, can’t hide my hunger.”

they’re passing by the courtyard and see a dog named argos—
this poor dusty pup that odysseus raised way back in the day.
the poor dog’s old, lying on a dung heap, neglected with odysseus gone.
argos twitches his tail, tries to perk up at the sight of his real master,
but can’t get up. odysseus discreetly wipes a tear and asks eumaeus,
“who’s that dog?” eumaeus tells the sad story, how argos was unstoppable back
when odysseus was around but now rots away, because slaves get lazy
when no boss is there to hold them accountable.
then eumaeus steps inside, argos breathes his last,
happy to see his master one final time.

telemachus spots eumaeus entering with the beggar in tow,
signals him over, sets him a place. a herald places them
some bread and meat to munch on. odysseus sits on the threshold,
leaning against a cypress doorpost, looking super pitiful
with those tattered clothes. telemachus quietly hooks him up with more food,
whispering to eumaeus to tell the old dude to beg from everyone.
odysseus starts going around, suitors dropping scraps in his bag,
some pitying him, some side-eyeing him.

then melanthius (goat guy) starts blabbering, “i saw him before—
he’s just some random eumaeus dragged in.”
antinoos snaps at eumaeus, “why the fuck you bring another leech around,
as if we didn’t have enough freeloaders already?”
telemachus is like, “chill, antinoos. that’s not how we treat guests, smh.”

odysseus begs at each table, eventually he hits up antinoos:
“dude, you look alpha, definitely got wealth. how ‘bout a lil’ bread?”
antinoos pops off, “don’t stand by my table or you’ll catch a fade.
you scamming mooch. you go house to house for freebies.”
he picks up a stool and smashes odysseus’s shoulder.
everyone is like, “wtf antinoos, that’s messed up,”
‘cause it might be a god in disguise. you never know.

odysseus holds in his rage but gives a subtle warning:
“if there’s any justice, you’ll be done for this.
you didn’t knock me out defending your flocks or possessions—
you smacked me just for being hungry, bruh.”
antinoos is like, “shut up or i’ll have the boys drag you out.”

all the other suitors cringe: “yo, that was lowkey savage, antinoos.”
telemachus sees his father get beaned but just quietly fumes,
knowing this is all part of the plan.

inside, penelope hears the commotion, calls a maid,
prays apollo might strike antinoos. eury-nome the housekeeper
adds, “and all the suitors, honestly.” penelope’s like, “facts, but antinoos is the worst.”

she summons eumaeus: “bring that beggar so i can ask about odysseus.
maybe he’s heard rumors if he’s traveled far.”
eumaeus says, “queen, the guy’s got some wild stories.
he claims to be your husband’s old cretan friend,
and he says he’s heard odysseus is still alive, somewhere near the thesprotians.”
penelope: “then hustle him up here. i gotta hear more.”

but odysseus, spooked by suitors, is like, “tell the queen i’ll talk to her at sundown,
less drama. i don’t want these suitors clowning me again.
i’m old and ragged, but i have my pride.”
penelope hears that and goes, “fair enough; not a dumb beggar at least.”

eumaeus quietly warns telemachus, “i’m heading back to the swine.
you be safe, watch your back, these suitors have no chill.”
telemachus nods: “that’s the move. i’ll handle business here.”

so eumaeus bounces, telemachus stays with the crowd.
they keep feasting, boozing, dancing, the whole fiasco,
with darkness creeping in, and the night’s chaos soon to unfold.
