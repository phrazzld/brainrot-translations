yooo so big daddy odysseus stayed posted in the main hall,
plotting murder vibes on those cringe suitors, athena backing him up hardcore.
on the dl, he gave telemachus a quick pep talk:

“fam, we gotta stow away these armors asf, stash every last shield, spear,
and helmet in the back, and if any of these dudes ask ‘bruh, what’s up,
why you messing with your pops’ gear?’ you’ll just be like,
‘they were dusty asl, and your boy odysseus left ‘em behind so long ago—
they got all roasty from the smoke, no longer dripping like they used to.
plus, i was bffr that if y’all got hammered and started beef,
you’d wreck each other with swords up in here,
and that’s a big yikes. you know the vibes: cold iron is savage.’”

telemachus caught that vibe, told eurycleia the nurse
to keep the ladies on lock while they stacked the gear in the storeroom.
nurse was like, “um, who gon’ hold the lantern though?”
telemachus said, “chill, bestie here (nodding at disguised odysseus) will handle.”
so they bolted the doors. father and son hauled out the war kit,
helmets and big boy shields gleaming, spears all lethal,
while up front, queen athena came in clutch,
flexing a golden lamp that lit up the hall like it was burning midday fire.
telemachus deadass stared: “pops, no cap, it’s bright as day in here,
like the walls be shining from some cosmic flame. is there a god on site?”

odysseus, 300 iq lord of cunning, whispered, “shhh. hush that energy, kid.
the gods got their own style, no need to question.
just crash, i’ll wrap up some final strings, let the queen and her girls
get in their feelings while i’m here. i’m playing the long con.”
so telemachus dipped to his nice room, candlelight flickering behind.

in came penelope, baddie vibes like artemis or golden aphrodite,
and the maids set a fancy seat for her near the fire,
where she perched on that carved, ivory-decked chair,
looking like a legit goddess, tears basically glistening in her eyes.
the suitors had already left the place messy, crumbs of bread and spilled wine,
so the maids cleared the scraps, tossed the torches aside, stoked new logs,
and meltdown meltdown: melanthô (some suitor-simping staff) snarked at odysseus:
“yo old dusty, you still bumming around after dark, creeping on the ladies?
this is out of pocket. better bounce or get yeeted out by a torch.”

odysseus turned savage: “girl, you delusionship-coded if you think i’m worthless
just cuz i’m reppin’ dirty rags. fact is, fate’s been cooking me,
but watch your vibe, else your real boss or even big odysseus returns
and sees you wildin’. or maybe telemachus will overhear and clap back.
you’d best hush that.”

penelope heard that. she put that clueless maid on blast:
“are you for real, you boujee clown? i see all. you’ll catch these consequences soon.”
then to eurycleia: “sis, bring a stool and throw some fleeces on it.
i wanna talk to this wanderer—he might have tea on odysseus. i’m down bad.”

so they brought a seat, and odysseus perched. penelope asked,
“stranger, who you be, where you from? gimme the deets.”

quicksilver king replied, “my queen, your fame goes global.
but let me skip my origin story, i’ve had enough heartbreak for multiple seasons.
just trust i’ve roamed all over. prying deeper might make me cry like a baby.
people gon’ say i’m mid for bawling in another man’s house.”

penelope sighed, tears rolling like meltdown city, “stranger, i’ve lost my glow,
ever since my man odysseus left for that toxic war at troy.
now i got these cringe suitors draining the house. i pulled cunning stunts
like weaving a big funeral shroud by day and undoing it by night,
stalling them for three years. but they caught me lacking,
and now the wedding pressure’s on. but i cling to hope.
anyway, say you met him? describe his vibe, his drip.”

odysseus spun that well-crafted lie about crete, him hooking odysseus up with xenia,
lavishing him with fits, how the storm blew him off course.
he recalled the purple cloak, golden brooch with a fancy dog-chasing-fawn design,
and penelope melted, tears glistening like meltdown snow in the sun.
but our boi hid his own tears, rock-solid, trying not to blow his cover.

she probed further, he doubled down: “yep, i saw your man.
he’s collecting some serious bag out there, about to come home soon—
that’s on zeus. i’ll give an oath if you want. he’s near. trust that.”

penelope was big sad still: “i want to believe, bestie,
i’d shower you with spoils if that were so, but i’m jaded.
these suitors are parasites, and there’s no more host like odysseus
to fling them out. but okay, dear maids, wash this traveler’s feet,
make him comfy so he can vibe tonight. i’ll go cry alone in my upstairs gloom.”

odysseus: “nah, i’ll pass the foot-wash unless there’s an old real one in the house.
someone who’s seen some stuff. i don’t want some random basic chick on my dogs.”

penelope replied, “bingo. we got eurycleia, an og caretaker who raised him from birth.
she’s prime. eurycleia, do your thing.”

the old nurse stepped up, tears in her eyes, recognized the scar on his leg,
the same gnarly slash from that boar on parnassus, back when grandpa autolycus was top-tier in sneaky cunning.
the second her hand brushed the scar, she realized the truth: odysseus.

she gasped, nearly turned to penelope to spill the beans,
but odysseus clamped her throat gently, growling, “ma’am, if you snitch, you’re done for.
i love you like a second mother but keep it hush or we all get crashed out.”
eurycleia swore to keep it on the dl: “child, i am not capping. i’ll keep hush.
and once you clap these suitors, i’ll name which maids were real and who were traitors.”

odysseus said, “that’s all me. just hush now, let the gods handle it.”

the old nurse finished washing him, mind basically blown.
odysseus pulled his ragged cloak around the scar, saving that hush hush.

penelope sat again, told him about her dream: “i saw twenty geese in the yard,
all eating from my grain trough, but then a monstrous eagle swooped and murked them.
i bawled, it came back, perched on the roof, and in a human voice said,
‘chill, penelope, i’m your hubby come to bring suitor doom.’
then i woke, found the geese still actually there, so i was big confused.”

odysseus said, “bro, that’s obviously the suitors as geese and your man as the eagle.
straight up you’re seeing prophecy. the suitors are cooked.”

penelope, still half-delulu: “dreams can be sus, some come from horns, some from ivory gates.
not all come true, but i gotta do this: tomorrow i’m hosting an archery contest with the big bow.
whoever can string it easy and shoot an arrow clean through twelve axe heads,
i’m wifing them. i can’t stall forever. i’m tired.”

odysseus: “girl, do what you gotta do, but i’m telling you,
odysseus is def about to make his drop soon, no joke. the suitors are toast.”

she sighed: “if only. anyway, i gotta crash. i’m done for the night.
you can bed down here, wherever, i’m out. see y’all in the morning.”

so penelope climbed her glitzy upper chamber with her maids,
weeping for her lost king until grey-eyed athena dropped sweet slumber on her.
