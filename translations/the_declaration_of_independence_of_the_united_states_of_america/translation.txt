=========================================================== deadass, glitchin’ vibes overload ============================================================  
   
     note: yo quick heads up nn this file is like a mashup of the first two project gutenberg uploads, both sportin’ filenumber #1, with a bunch of doppelganger files lurkin’ around, updated over mad years – all the OG files chill in the "old" subdirectory (hit up the "more files" listing in the pg catalog) and nothing’s been switched up in these raw etexts, big yikes and all that  
   
===========================================================  
   
**welcome to the world of free plain vanilla electronic texts** – welcome to the drip zone of free, basic yet legendary digital texts, deadass lit  
   
**etexts readable by both humans and by computers, since 1971** – these etexts be flexin’ on both homies and machines since way back in 1971, no cap  
   
*these etexts prepared by hundreds of volunteers and donations* – mad props to the hundos of squad members and coin donors who kept this vibe alive, legit savage  
   
below you will find the first nine project gutenberg etexts, all smooshed in one file with one header to keep overhead low – cuz the gopher site keeper was all like “yo, cut the header spam” so we yeeted extra text for that low-key hustle, fr fr  
   
however, for legal and financial drip, we gotta keep these headers at the front of every file posted in any general user hangouts – project gutenberg be run mostly by dope donations from peeps like you, deadass  
   
if you peep our books posted anywhere without these headers, slide into their dms and ask them to re-attach the header, cuz without it they’re left naked wrt legal protection and our donation grind goes sus, no cap  
   
***start**the small print!**for public domain etexts**start*** – brace yourself, here comes the micro-legal tea, deadass, no chill  
   
why is this "small print!" statement here? yo, because lawyers be flexin’ and need to drop that legal heat, on god  
   
they straight up tell us you might throw a lawsuit if your copy glitches, even if it’s free off someone else, even if the fail ain’t on us – so this "small print!" spins out most of our liability, and also drops the deets on how you can ship copies of this etext if you’re feelin’ it, legit  
   
*before!* you use or read this etext – before you dive in, peep this crucial setup, deadass  
   
by using or reading any part of this project gutenberg-tm etext, u’re basically saying “i read, i agree, i accept” this wild "small print!" statement – if you ain't vibin’, you can snag a refund for any coin you dropped by hollerin’ at the person you got it from within 30 days, and if it’s on a physical medium like a disk, you gotta yeet it back with your request, no cap  
   
about project gutenberg-tm etexts – listen up, this is the lowdown on the project’s drip  
   
this project gutenberg-tm etext, like most of its crew, is a "public domain" masterpiece served up by professor michael s. hart via the project gutenberg association at illinois benedictine college (the "project") – which basically means no one’s cashing in on copyright for this work, so the project (and you, deadass) can copy and share it in the usa all day, no permission and no royalty fees required – special rules (detailed below) kick in if you wanna copy and distribute this etext under the "project gutenberg" trademark, so keep it one hunnit  
   
to drop these etexts, the project goes full sigma grind to identify, transcribe, and proofread public domain bangers – but fr, sometimes they hit glitches and you might get "defects" like incomplete, off data, transcription fails, copyright slip-ups, busted disks, or even computer viruses and buggy code wrecking your gear – big yikes, deadass  
   
limited warranty; disclaimer of damages – limited warranty; disclaimer of damages: nah fam, we ain’t responsible for your tech nightmares, legal fees, or any mad mess, on god  
   
but aside from the "right of replacement or refund" (see below), [1] the project (and any squad you got this etext from, project gutenberg-tm style) disclaims all liability for damages, costs, expenses, including legal fees, and [2] you ain't got any backup for negligence, strict liability, or breach of warranty/contract – this includes indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages, even if you holler "yo, potential glitch" beforehand, deadass

this etext is served as-is – no extra warranties, expressed or implied, are dropped about the etext or its medium, including any merchantability or fitness for your next-level project, deadass no cap  
   
some states ain't cool with disclaimers of implied warranties or limiting consequential damages, so the above deets might not flex on you if you’re in one of those zones – u might have extra legal rights, big yikes  
   
indemnity – yo, indemnity time: you gotta cover our backs, fam  
   
you agree to indemnify and keep the project, its directors, officers, members, and agents totally unbothered from any liability, costs, or legal fees that pop off – whether from u distributing, altering, or adding to this etext, or any defect shenanigans, so hold that thought and yeet responsibly, deadass

   [*] the etext, when displayed, is crystal readable and contains only the characters intended by the original author (tildes, asterisks, and underlines can flex punctuation, plus extra chars for hypertext links are cool), or  
   [*] the etext can be easily converted by the reader for free into plain ascii, ebcdic, or an equivalent form by the program that shows the etext (like most word processors do), or  
   [*] you provide, or agree to provide on request at zero extra cost, a copy of the etext in its OG plain ascii form (or in ebcdic/or a similar proprietary vibe), no cap  
   
[2] follow the etext refund and replacement rules as laid out in this "small print!" statement – respect the drip, no cap  
   
[3] drop a trademark license fee to the project equal to 20% of the net profits u earn (calculated with your standard tax method) – if u ain’t earning bank, no fee is due; royalties go to "project gutenberg association / illinois benedictine college" within 60 days of filing your annual (or periodic) tax return, on god  
   
what if u *want* to send money even if u don't have to? – if u’re extra and wanna drop cash even when it ain’t required, bless up  
   
the project madly appreciates contributions in money, time, scanning rigs, ocr software, public domain etexts, royalty-free copyright licenses, and every wild kind of help u can imagine – cash goes to "project gutenberg association / illinois benedictine college", deadass

december, 1971  [etext #1] – vintage drop, deadass retro drip  
   
the project gutenberg etext of the declaration of independence – here it is, the OG digital manifesto, ready to yeet into history  
   
all of the original project gutenberg etexts from the 1970's were produced in all caps, no lower case – cuz back then, computers didn’t even know chill lower case existed, all caps flex only, fr fr  
   
this is a retranscription of one of the first project gutenberg etexts, officially dated december, 1971-- and now officially re-released on december 31, 1993-- – a straight up repost from the old school days to the mega re-release era, deadass  
   
the united states declaration of independence was the first etext – the legendary OG drop that started it all, no cap, pure historic yeet 

released by project gutenberg, early in 1971, fr fr yo this was totes stored in some emailed drip instructions that demanded a tape or diskpack be hand mounted like, deadass retrieval mode activated lol  
the diskpack was literally the size of a humongous cake in a cake carrier, cost a sweet $1500, and had like 5 mb of data, of which this file yeeted like 1-2% cuz why not, amirite??  
two tape backups were chillin’ plus one on paper tape cuz we like vintage vibes, no cap  
the 10,000 files we’re tryna drop online by the end of 2001 should lowkey take about 1-2% of a similarly priced drive in 2001, omg what a flex  

this file was never copyrighted, sharewared, etc., so basically it’s for all y’all to use, yeet, and copy however you vibe  
feel free to remix and drop your own edition using this as your base—meme magic, big yikes, all the ways  

in my deep dive research for this transcription of our first etext, i came across so many wack discrepancies [even in that official us doc drop] that i was like, “bruh, even the ‘facsimiles’ of the declaration of independence are sus and gonna come out all diff from the OG, and from each other, no cap.”  
there’s literally a whole buffet of random capitalization, punctuation, and name placements [and btw, i axed some names cuz they were extra]  

the final doc got rid of a bunch o’ spelling fails from those old parchment “facsimiles” i scooped back in 1971, which i probs can’t even fetch rn, including “brittain” lol

**the project gutenberg etext of the declaration of independence**  

=======================================================================  

note: this html remix of the OG project gutenberg etext #1 was whipped up on august 4, 2018 to literally replace that lame auto-generated file, so this major pg vibe could flex on mobile screens  
images of thomas jefferson’s hand-drafted copy of the declaration of independence got slapped in for extra clout  
the original project gutenberg header and footer stayed in the mix cuz legacy, gtfo

the declaration of independence of the united states of america

when in the course of human events, deadass it becomes necessary for one squad to yeet the political bands that once glued them to another crew, and to step up among the powers of this wild earth into that separate and equal space that nature and nature’s god legit grant, a proper flex of respect for mankind’s opinions demands they spill the tea on why they gotta split, no cap, 4k style

we hold these truths to be self-evident, like fr fr every human being is born equal, blessed by their creator with unalienable rights (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, periodt)  
and to lock down these rights, governments are set up amongst us, grabbing their power straight from the consent of the people, ya feel me?  
whenever any kind of government starts glitching and messing up these ends, it’s on the people to yeet or even shutdown that system and bring in a fresh one built on dope principles and organized in a way that’s lit for their safety and happiness—so extra, right?  
prudence, like the ultimate sigma, will say that old school governments shouldn’t be flipped for minor, transient drama; and all our past experiences prove that people usually stick with the suck if evil is lowkey bearable, rather than yeeting the system they’re used to  
but when a long-ass train of abuses and power grabs, all chasing the same sus objective, shows a plan to land us under total despotism, then it’s not just an option, it’s the duty to toss that weak government, and set up brand new guards for future secure vibes—facts, yo!  
such has been the chill suffering of these colonies and now the necessity is lit that forces them to scramble and flip their old government systems—like, forced by cosmic destiny, fr fr  
the saga of the current king of great britain is nothing but a reel of repeated injuries and power trips, all aimed at setting up an absolute tyranny over these states  
to prove dis, let the facts get caught in 4k and submitted to a no-filter, candid world

he has straight up refused his assent to laws that are vibes for the public good, like major nope

he has blocked his governors from passing laws that are urgent and needed in a snap unless they chill until his consent drops; and even then when paused, he ghosted on them hard, mad neglect, fr

he has refused to push other laws meant to ease life for big groups of people unless those peeps sacrifice their lit right of representation in the legislature—a right that’s infinite in value and only fearsome to tyrants, no cap

he has gathered legislative squads in spots that are weird, hella uncomfortable and mega far from where their public records are stored, all just to tire them out into following his bogus measures—big yikes

he has repeatedly yeeted representative houses when they stood up with maximal manly firmness against his savage invasions on people’s rights—pure gigachad resistance

after dissolving these houses, he ghosted for long periods on calling for new elections; so that the legislative powers, which can’t just be vaporized, got forced back into the people’s hands for use—meanwhile the state is left chillin’ exposed to invaders from all sides and internal convulsions, like an absolute dumpster fire

he has gone on a mission to slow down the growth of these states, straight up obstructing naturalization laws meant for foreigners; he’s not passing any fresh ones that could boost migration here, and even upping the game on new land appropriation rules—total clout grab, smh

he has blocked the administration of justice by giving a hard no to laws that would set up judiciary powers—nah bruh, justice can’t flex here

he’s made judges ride solely on his whims for the duration of their gigs and for the whole pay packet deal—dependency level: cringe af

he’s built a whole squadron of new offices and sent in swarms of officers to bug our people and literally snatch away their resources—npcs getting rekt

he’s maintained standing armies among us during peace like he’s ordering extra military clout without our legislatures even giving a nod—straight-up arms on arms, big yikes

he has played the game to make the military go all independent and flex way above the civil power—talk about an ego trip

he’s teamed up with other shady players to subject us to a foreign jurisdiction that’s totally off-brand from our constitution and not even recognized by our laws; giving his nod to their laughable acts of fake legislation:

for quartering huge squads of armed troops among us like a never-ending sleepover of soldiers

for shielding those troops with a bogus trial, letting them dodge punishment for any murders they casually commit on our peeps—pure scam, deadass

for slashing off our trade with every corner of the globe—like cut the connect, bruh

for hitting us with taxes outta nowhere without our squad’s consent—tax spam much?!

for robbing us, in mad cases, of the epic benefits of trial by jury—justice left on read

for shipping us over seas to get tried for so-called offences—international yeet of justice, lol

for scrapping the free system of english laws in a neighbor province, setting up an arbitrary government there, and blowing up its boundaries so it can be a poster child for enforcing the same absolute rule in these colonies—mega cringe and totally sus

for snatching our charters, axing our most cherished laws, and fundamentally flipping the forms of our governments—system hacked, af

for freezing our own legislatures and declaring themselves the boss with full power to drop laws on us for every case imaginable—ultimate power trip, on god

he has straight up abdicated real government here by ditching us out of his protection and going to war against his own people—total betrayal, bruh

he has looted our seas, wrecked our coasts, torched our towns, and straight-up demolished the lives of our peeps—absolute wreckage, no chill

he is currently shipping massive armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the world of death, destruction, and tyranny, already started with such epic cruelty & perfidy that it’s like a brutal throwback to the darkest ages, and is totally unworthy of running a so-called civilized nation—big dark energy, deadass

he has forced our fellow citizens captured on the high seas to grab arms against their own country, turning them into executioners of their homies or getting themselves rekt by their own squad’s hands—talk about twisted fate, omg

he’s sparked domestic insurrections among us and is trying to roll in the savage, no-mercy indian tribes on our frontiers, whose battle mode is all about obliterating peeps of every age, gender, and vibe—major savage mode activated

in every freakin’ phase of these oppressions, we’ve been dropping humble petitions for redress—our endless petitions got hit back with nothing but more repeated injuries, like every time is a new cringe moment  
a prince whose whole character is lit with all these tyrannical acts is totally unfit to rule a free squad—facts, period

nor have we ghosted on our british brethren—been sliding warnings nonstop about their legislature’s attempts to extend bogus jurisdiction over us  
we’ve clued them in on the drama surrounding our emigration and sick settlement vibes here  
we’ve appealed to their native justice and mega magnanimity, and even conjured them up with the familial vibes of our common heritage to disavow these straight-up usurpations, which would for real interrupt our connections and sweet convos—all in the name of saving our vibe  
but they too left us on read, deaf to the calls of justice and deep blood ties  
so we gotta roll with the necessity that screams our separation, and hold them as we hold the rest of humanity—enemies in war, in peacetime still sorta friends, like a twisted love/hate saga, deadass, on god, no cap, roflmao.

yo yo we are the reps of the us of america, chillin in general congress and all assembled like a total squad, appealin hard to the supreme judge of the world (no cap, deadass) for that 100 vibe on our intentions so in the name and by the authority of the good ppl of these colonies we drop this solemn truth bomb: these united colonies are straight up meant to be free and independent states fr fr; they ghost all allegiances to the british crown and yeet every extra political link with the state of great britain like, dissolved for real, and as free and independent states they got full power to flex at war, lock in peace, squad up alliances, set up commerce, and do all the other dope moves independent states are meant to do, big yikes! and for the support of this epic declaration, ridin on that divine providence boss energy, we mutually pledge our lives, fortunes, and our sacred honor, no cap skibidi!

december, 1972 [etext #2]

****the project gutenberg etext of the u. s. bill of rights****

----------------------------------------

the united states bill of rights.  
the ten original amendments to the constitution of the united states passed by congress september 25, 1789 ratified december 15, 1791

----------------------------------------

i  
yo congress ain't gonna drop any sus law to set up a religion squad or ban the free flex of spiritual vibes, nor clip the mad freedom of speech or the press drip, or the squad's right to chill and assemble to hit up the gov for redress on any whack grievances, deadass!

----------------------------------------

ii  
aight, so a well-regulated militia is key to guardin that free state drip so the right for the squad to keep and bear arms is never gonna be snatched – yeet all infringements, no cap!

----------------------------------------

iii  
yo, no soldier is gonna crash in your crib during chill times without your straight up consent, and even in wartime they gotta follow the law vibe, fr fr!

----------------------------------------

iv  
alright fam, the right for ppl to stay secure in their bods, cribs, docs, and swag means no random sus searches or snatching of your goods – any warrant that pops off must roll with legit probable cause, backed by an oath or affirmation, and spell out exactly which spot and which peeps or things are getting peeped or snatched, deadass!

----------------------------------------

v  
listen up squad, nobody gets held accountable for a major or hella infamous crime unless a grand jury drops that indictment tea, except when you’re deep in land/naval forces or the militia during real war or public danger drama; plus, no one gets hit twice for the same sus move, and yo, you ain’t forced to snitch on yourself or lose your life, freedom, or cash without proper due process, and no one's private swag is gonna get yeeted for public biz without straight-up fair coin compensation, on god!

----------------------------------------

vi  
yo in any criminal drama the accused gets that mad quick and public trial with an unbiased jury from the exact state and district where the tea went down (all laid out by law), and they gotta be fully clued in on the charge deets, face off with the haters throwing shade, have a compulsion to fetch their own witness squad, and score some legit lawyer backup for defense, no cap!

----------------------------------------

vii  
in any common law tea, if the drama’s value exceeds twenty bucks, the jury trial right stays on fleek, and no fact that’s been juiced by a jury gets re-examined in any u. s. court outside the common law rulebook, deadass!

----------------------------------------

viii  
yo, there’s no way anyone’s gonna get hit with insanely high bail, absurd fines, or any savage, twisted punishments – big yikes!

----------------------------------------

ix  
listen up, just 'cause the constitution drops a list of rights doesn’t mean it can ghost or trash the other rights that our squad still holds tight, on god fr fr!

----------------------------------------

x  
and yo, any powers the constitution doesn’t hand to the u. s. or straight-up disallow for the states are totally reserved for the states or the ppl themselves, locked in tight, no cap!

1.e.9. if u wanna charge a fee or drop a project gutenberg™ e-work or a whole batch of works on diff terms than the basic blueprint, u gotta slide in a written permission from the project gutenberg literary archive foundation, the boss of the project gutenberg™ trademark – hit up the foundation as outlined in section 3 below, deadass!!!

1.f.
1.f.1. yo fam project gutenberg volunteers & employees be grinding super hard, legit deep-diving into copyright tea, transcribing, and proofreading work that ain’t protected by u.s. law – all for that gutenberg™ drip, no cap. but even with all that hustle, these digital works and the media they crash on might be packed with “defects” like half-ass data, glitchy errors, corrupt files, transcription slip-ups, copyright drama, busted disks, virus vibes, or code that can straight-up wreck your gear – caught in 4k, fr fr, skibidi!!

1.f.2. yo, limited warranty & damage disclaimer mode activated – aside from the “right of replacement or refund” deets in 1.f.3, the project gutenberg literary archive foundation, trademark boss, and any squad dropping a project gutenberg™ e-work under this deal are ghostin’ all liability for damages, costs, and legal fee drama. u agree that u got zero remedies for negligence, strict liability, warranty breaches, or contract fails except what’s in 1.f.3 – foundation, trademark peeps, and distributors ain’t liable for any actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damage even if u warn them, big yikes, no cap.

1.f.3. aight, limited right of replacement or refund vibes: if u peep a defect in this digital masterpiece within 90 days of copping it, u can get a refund on the coin u spent by sliding a written explanation to whoever hooked u up. if u got it on a physical medium, u gotta return that medium along with your written tea. the provider might decide to drop a replacement copy instead of refund cash – and if u got it electronically, they might grant a second shot to deliver it digitally in lieu of refund. but if that second drop is also trash, u can demand a refund in writing, no extra chances to yeet the issue, deadass.

1.f.4. besides the replacement/refund hookup in 1.f.3, this work is served to u as-is, with zero extra warranties of any kind, express or implied – not even that merchantable or purpose-fit flex, on god.

1.f.5. yo, some states are too extra and don’t let u ghost certain implied warranties or cap off some damage types. if any disclaimer or limit here breaks state law, then it’s reinterpreted to max out the allowed disclaimer or limitation under that state’s rules – and the rest of the provisions stay lit, so stay woke, fam.

1.f.6. indemnity time – u agree to shield and hold harmless the foundation, the trademark boss, any agent or employee of the foundation, anyone droppin’ copies of project gutenberg™ e-works per this deal, and all volunteer legends involved in producing, promoting, and distributing these works, from any and all liability, costs, and legal fee mess-ups that come direct or indirect from any of the following u do or trigger: (a) distributing this or any project gutenberg™ work, (b) remixing, modifying, or addin’ or deletin’ parts of any project gutenberg™ work, and (c) any defect u cause – deadass, no cap!!!

section 3. information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation

section 4. information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation  
look, gutenberg™ is all about that free digital drip but can’t even survive without massive public support & donation coin to ramp up the count of public domain and licensed works that can be freely dropped in machine-readable form on any tech – even that outdated gear. small donations from $1 to $5,000 are pure gold for keeping that tax-exempt status with the irs, fr fr. the foundation is hella committed to staying compliant with charity laws across all 50 states, but yo, that compliance hustle is a whole circus of paperwork and fees. they don’t solicit donations in spots where they haven’t locked in written compliance – so if u wanna send coin or check on a state’s compliance status, slide over to www.gutenberg.org/donate. while they ain’t chasing contributions in non-compliant states, unsolicited coin drops are always welcome from those places. international donations are mad appreciated too, but they can’t spill tea on tax treats for off-us coin – u.s. laws totally swamp their tiny crew. peep the project gutenberg web pages for the current donation methods and addresses – checks, online payments, credit card vibes, all that jazz. donate at www.gutenberg.org/donate, period.

section 5. general information about project gutenberg™ electronic works  
yo, prof michael s. hart was the original brainiac behind the gutenberg™ concept – a library of e-works for free sharing with anyone, no cap. for like 40 years, he was dropping and distributing gutenberg™ ebooks with just a loose network of volunteer hustle. these ebooks are usually mashed up from a mix of printed editions, all confirmed as not being locked by u.s. copyright (unless a copyright notice is slapped on), so they might not follow any one printed vibe exactly – big yikes. most peeps kick off their journey at the main pg site with the search plug: www.gutenberg.org – legit. this site spills all the deets on gutenberg™, including how to drop donations to the literary archive foundation, how to help churn out new ebooks, and how to sub to the email newsletter to catch every fresh ebook drop, on god.
